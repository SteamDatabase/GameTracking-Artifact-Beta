"DCG_VO_vanessa_buying_time"	"Pierpont and I don’t agree on a lot of things, but he was wise to recognize the dangers of angering The Faceless Void. I'm not super wild about the Claszureme Treaty, Chronomancy was a lot of fun. But you know what's also fun? Not having your timeline obliterated."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_whispers_of_madness"	"Pierpont always warns me about 'dabbling with things you don't understand'. Most of the time he's being a sanctimonious bastard... unfortunately sometimes he's right. Well, mostly right, I mean I've never died permanently. Ya know, now that I think about it, he's basically always just being a sanctimonious bastard."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_relentless_zombie"	"The dead are rising in Roseleaf, Knogh...someone took the Oath."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_howling_mind"	"It doesn't happen often, but every now and again a wizard is allowed to leave the Tyler Estate... though when they do they are irreparably changed."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_aghanims_sanctum"	"Aghanim is the greatest wizard of all time. There is no question. There is no debate. No one is his equal. So when he vanished one day, we never wondered 'how' we wondered 'why.' Some say he feared for his life and ran into hiding, but I don't believe that for a second. You ask me, Aghanim is working on something. Something important. Something that will change the world."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_arcane_assault"	"Rubick claims to be Aghanim's son. I'm not sure I believe it, but I certainly wouldn't say that to Rubick's face."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_glyph_of_confusion"	"It is a nasty world out there, and when a non-trivial percentage of it would like to see you dead you learn to take certain precautionary measures."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_the_tyler_estate"	"Most of the magical world acknowledges the authority of the Sapphire Conclave. But in Weeping Rose, we govern ourselves, answering only to the Quorum, a senate of 31 powerful wizards. And while Weeping Rose is not home to many rules, the few we have are obeyed without question. Because to fail to do so is to be sent to the Tyler Estate."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_intro"	"Fighting is like crushing someone's skull with a tree trunk. That's an analogy!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_brusier_fighting_instinct"	"Life is a series of people trying to kill you. Kill them first."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Weapon."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Better than a fist."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"It's not a rock, but it'll do."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I think I swing it like a tree."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"<i>low chuckle</i>"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I can't believe this fits..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_02"	"No one is killing me."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_03"	"This keeps the blood inside."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I don't like getting stabbed."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_05"	"I'll live longer."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"This helps."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Thanks."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I look so fancy."

"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_03"	"It's an honor to break skulls for you Magi."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_04"	"What's it like in the Bronze Legion?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_05"	"I like your fancy metal tattoo."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_06"	"You should eat Tresdin and become Commander."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_07"	"You really know how to get a good arc with those corpses."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_08"	"You gotta teach me how to toss some bodies."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_09"	"My favorite part is when you throw the dead bodies."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_10"	"Well look at the fancy pit fighter."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_11"	"You think cause you know all them big words you're better than me?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_12"	"Ogre only needs two arm to kill you, corpse man!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_13"	"I like your hair."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_14"	"You're nice Maiden. I hope no one crushes your skull."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_15"	"I fight for the Radiant."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_16"	"The Radiant give me purpose!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_17"	"Thanks for showing me the way Prellex."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_18"	"I fight for the Dire."

"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_05"	"Show them our strength!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_06"	"Burn it all!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_07"	"Smash them!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_08"	"We will win!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_09"	"They can't stop us!"

"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_health_05"	"It's important to stay healthy. That way you can kill more people."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_03"	"You can't outfight me."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_04"	"You're putting up a good fight, but it's not enough."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_05"	"A worthy, but futile effort."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_save_01"	"You're not as cunning as you thought."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_permanent_armor_02"	"I will be protected."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_permanent_armor_03"	"I won't be moved so easily."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_01"	"Coward!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_02"	"You should run."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_03"	"You aren't prepared."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_04"	"You're a stranger here."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_05"	"You're out of your element."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_06"	"Your body rebels against you."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_08"	"You aren't strong enough to defeat us..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_09"	"You aren't so impressive."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_07"	"Surrender!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_08"	"I'll end this foolishness..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_09"	"This is a fight you'll never win!"

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_06"	"I knew we could pull this off."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_07"	"It's almost over."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_08"	"How fortunate."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_09"	"I told you to have faith."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_10"	"What could stop us now?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_01"	"Troubling..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_02"	"This is a problem."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_03"	"I need to find a way to fix this."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_04"	"I can't stand idly by."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_05"	"I need to think fast..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_06"	"There has to be a solution."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_07"	"If I don’t find a solution we're all dead."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_08"	"Time is running out"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_09"	"This is every leader's nightmare..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_10"	"I won't lose hope."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_01"	"How dare you!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_02"	"You will answer for this!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_03"	"You won't leave here alive!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_04"	"I'll rip you in half!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_05"	"I won't allow this farce to continue!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_06"	"This ends now!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_07"	"Show me what you're made of!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_08"	"You're in over your head."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_09"	"You overstepped."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_10"	"What chance do you have against someone like me?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_01"	"I am what the jungle fears..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_02"	"I am first among my people"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_03"	"There is a reason why my people turn to me for leadership..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_04"	"Surrender and save us all some time."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_05"	"You're outmatched."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_06"	"Clearly you weren't prepared for this fight."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_07"	"I was expecting more from you..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_08"	"You aren't worthy to face me..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_09"	"You thought you could beat me? Please..."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_04"	"There is much power in belief."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_05"	"The gods smile on this place."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_06"	"We are blessed indeed."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_07"	"This is a dangerous place for outsiders."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_08"	"The jungle contains many mysteries..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_09"	"This can change the tide..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_10"	"I'm used to being under estimated."

"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_intro"	"Ever since I heard about the Jasper Circle I wanted to be apart of it, but a group like that... you don't ask to join, you have to be approached... which means you need to make a name for yourself. Six months I shadowed Sunbreeze. Six months of watching that stupid fairy do stupid merchant fairy things. Finally I had a plan. Then the Veiled Sisterhood went and assassinated Kwerthias which ruined everything. Sure I could have killed Sunbreeze, but then people would have given the Sisterhood the credit, so I just said to hell with it and scrapped everything."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_no_accident"	"Sometimes I get bored. That's usually when I push someone to their death."

"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_armor_04"	"It's a dangerous place out there..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_armor_05"	"I'm always ready for someone to come at me...."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Great."

"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_14"	"How was the Revtel job?"
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_15"	"Tell ya what, help me kill Axe and I'll make sure Goodkind is all yours..."

"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_02"	"What chance could you have against me."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_03"	"I've seen the future... you aren't in it."

"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_intro"	"There are number of things one could say about Zeus. He has a delightful mustache. His physique is chiseled out of marble. And when it comes to two-timing your wife while disguised as a swan, there is no equal. But one thing he is not is 'The God of Thunder'. For I am thunder. And lighting. And wind. And rain. Indeed, I am the tempest itself... and there is no god to whom I bow."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_rolling_storm"	"The worst part of meeting up with Zeus is the posturing we have to go through before we have a serious conversation."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_thunderstorm"	"Zeus destroyed a building, so I destroyed an army... I thought the matter was settled but then he decided to go throw a temper tantrum and crater a city."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_ball_lightning"	"The so-called 'God of Thunder' may use his feet to get around, but the true lord of lightning has a better means of travel..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Such a provincial & charming device!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Ah, how delightful!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"What fun we shall have on our adventures, little murder-weapon."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Ahhh long have I dreamed of holding death in my very hands."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Now which end makes blood come out..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I think this brings out my eyes..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_02"	"How snuggly..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I hereby declare myself ... fashion-forward!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Delightful! It doesn't even dull my glow..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_05"	"This is fitting of a man of my talents..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Ha ha! See how it glitters in my light!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Oh? Why, you shouldn't have!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"This is just lovely. I never tire of toys!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"I've always wanted one! How did you know?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"You really get me, don't you."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_01"	"A fitting and predictable end..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_02"	"Ahhh, I'm having fun. Are you having fun?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_03"	"All will bow before the lightning...."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_04"	"Watching people get electrocuted never gets old..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_05"	"You were a victim of a rising storm..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_06"	"Don't feel bad, friend, it was inevitable..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_07"	"You won't be the last..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_08"	"Better luck next time..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_09"	"This has been a fun day..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_10"	"What chance did you have against the storm itself..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_use_include_01"	"HAHAHAHHA!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_use_include_02"	"A storm's coming in!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_use_include_03"	"Let the sound of thunder mark my arrival!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_01"	"Watch and learn, lesser god..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_02"	"I think it's time we shake the heavens, Zeus..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_03"	"It's nice to be on the same side for once..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_04"	"Oh come on!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_05"	"You thought you were so special Zeus..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_06"	"How does it feel, Zeus?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_07"	"I've waited for this moment for so very long..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_08"	"After all this time, you think you have what it takes to defeat me Zeus?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_09"	"The excitement is palpable, the atmosphere ... electric!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_10"	"Ah, a pretender to my power! Such delightful sounds you shall make!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_11"	"Study well, mortal child, and someday you shall be a lesser version of me..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_12"	"I will clip your wings mortal..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_13"	"It was wise of you to seek my help Prellex."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_14"	"I can tell the Radiant has excellent taste..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_15"	"Oh Prellex... were I a philanderer like Zeus..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_16"	"The wind bows to no Ancient."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_17"	"Prellex, are you ready to get into some trouble..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_18"	"The combined might of the Radiant and the Dire mean nothing to me!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_19"	"You are a delightful lady Maiden, it's a shame I'm going to kill you."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_20"	"For a more agreeable companion, no spirit could ever ask!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_02"	"I love this part!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_03"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_04"	"A wise decision..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_05"	"You can't kill the storm..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_01"	"Everyone can relax, I have arrived."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_02"	"What a wonderful day to do battle!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_03"	"We'll make short work of this tower..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_04"	"Destroying the ancient will be a trivial effort..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_05"	"How can they stand against a force of nature!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_06"	"I have arrived and I have brought the thunder with me..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_07"	"Yes this is war, but it's important to have fun as well..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_08"	"Let's get into some trouble shall we..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_09"	"Oh I love this part..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_10"	"The anticipation is palpable.."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_01"	"Don't worry, it's almost over..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_02"	"You can't escape me..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_03"	"There's no place to hide..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_04"	"No more running..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_05"	"You made me work for it, I'll give you that."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_01"	"It's adorable that you think you can kill me."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_02"	"Amusing, but futile."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_03"	"Do try harder..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_04"	"Maybe you should try that on Zeus..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_05"	"Not so fast..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_01"	"The storm intensifies..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_02"	"I wish my brothers could see me now..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_03"	"I just keep getting better..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_04"	"Who would even face me?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_05"	"I've always liked being unkillable."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_01"	"I feel like I could shatter mountains..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_02"	"The power!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_03"	"Huzzah!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_04"	"It is foolishness to face me!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_05"	"Ahh how I look forward to electrocuting people..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_01"	"It's important to stay healthy..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_02"	"Yes! I grow!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_03"	"I grow tougher still..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_04"	"I can hardly contain myself!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_05"	"I haven't felt this good in ages..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_01"	"Time to play...."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_02"	"This is my favorite part..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_03"	"Hahahahaha!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_04"	"Hee hee!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_05"	"Oh the wonders you're about to behold..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_06"	"The spirits are capable of many things..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_07"	"Watch closely, you won't want to miss this..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_08"	"Let the fun begin!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_09"	"I can't wait to see what happens next..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_10"	"How glorious!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_01"	"You deserve this..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_02"	"A gift, from me to thee!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_03"	"Thought I'd leave you a little something."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_04"	"Resources are meant to be shared..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_05"	"Enjoy my friend..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_06"	"I was just thinking of you!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_07"	"Gifts! Gifts for all!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_08"	"Just because I'm self absorbed doesn't mean I'm selfish..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_09"	"Never say I didn't do anything for you..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_10"	"I'm always looking after my friends..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_01"	"This is going to be an unpleasant day for you..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_02"	"And would you believe, we're barely getting started?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_03"	"Try to keep up, will you?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_04"	"Don't worry. You haven't missed the big finale."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_05"	"This isn't going well for you, is it?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_06"	"You're not getting tired yet, are you?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_07"	"Don't be sad, you were outmatched from the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_08"	"That sensation you feel is the crushing weight of despair..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_09"	"You never had a chance, but it's nice that you tried..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_10"	"I make this look easy, don't I..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_01"	"You're barely a threat."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_02"	"Allow me to deal with this one..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_03"	"I'll dispatch you with grace and panache..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_04"	"This will be delightful..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_05"	"Killing mortals is always so refreshing..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_06"	"You shouldn't have made me angry..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_07"	"So you wish to face me? Very well."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_08"	"Too easy."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_09"	"Please, allow me..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_10"	"I'll handle this one."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_01"	"Look what I can do with a wave of my hand..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_02"	"These worms are beneath me..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_03"	"I'll swat these gnats..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_04"	"How could they possibly think they could win..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_05"	"They have numbers, but precious little else..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_06"	"This will be quick..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_07"	"It looks like my services are needed..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_08"	"Dance puppets, dance!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_09"	"I was hoping for a challenge, pity..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_10"	"Time to end this game."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_01"	"Let me give a little demonstration of my power..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_02"	"Well you put up a fight, I'll give you that."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_03"	"It's over."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_04"	"Time to die."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_05"	"Time for the grand finale."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_06"	"The end is coming..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_07"	"I love a good curtain call..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_08"	"Watch. This."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_09"	"God I love doing this..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_10"	"Death will be a mercy..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_01"	"Delightful!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_02"	"Glorious!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_03"	"Lovely!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_04"	"Oh, such heavenly delight!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_05"	"Grand!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_06"	"This pleases me..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_07"	"What a pleasant surprise..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_08"	"Well that was satisfying..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_09"	"What magnificent good fortune!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_10"	"What a good day..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_01"	"Oh my..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_02"	"Hmm..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_03"	"I don't know about this..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_04"	"This is... questionable..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_05"	"This isn't what I had in mind..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_06"	"There are lessons in adversity..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_07"	"This is rather unexpected."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_08"	"I... didn't account for this."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_09"	"This is worse than anticipated..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_10"	"Fear is what makes life worth living..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_01"	"Angering me was a foolish mistake..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_02"	"YOU DARE?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_03"	"You'll pay!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_04"	"This can't end well for you."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_05"	"I will make you suffer!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_06"	"I'll smite you where you stand..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_07"	"You face the storm's fury!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_08"	"I'll make you suffer!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_09"	"None can challenge me!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_10"	"You dare face me?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_01"	"How pathetic..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_02"	"No one is my equal..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_03"	"How pedestrian..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_04"	"You had no idea who you were facing did you..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_05"	"At least you entertained me before you died..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_06"	"Your ego will be your downfall."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_07"	"I can back up every claim I make..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_08"	"I make promises, not threats..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_09"	"Run before me!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_10"	"There's no escape from me!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_01"	"Who can know the will of the storm..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_02"	"My powers are boundless..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_03"	"I move on the wind..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_04"	"I bring glorious destruction..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_05"	"The toys of man are curious indeed..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_06"	"Who among you could hope to stop me?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_07"	"My power burns bright..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_08"	"And in a flash... you're dead."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_09"	"You and I are going to have some fun, I can tell..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_10"	"Time to get into a little trouble..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_death_01"	"<i>screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_ursa_intro"	"This isn't my fight. But if I don't stand with the Vhoul it's only a matter of time before the Bronze Legion comes for my people. A message needs to be sent... and it will be bloody."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enrage"	"When you see one of my people fight, it is not just a body on a battlefield. Each of us is joined by the spirits of our ancestors, and it's their strength that fuels us..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_rend_armor"	"The Keen believe that their soulless contraptions give them an edge in battle, but I will show them that their 'sci-ance' is not strong enough."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"My enemies will fall..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I'll wash this in blood..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"ready to fight..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I'm prepared for war..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I'll tear them asunder..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I won't fall ..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_02"	"They hunt me... but they won't kill me..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I won't be moved..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I won't meet the fate of my kin."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_05"	"I will defend my people.."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Interesting trinket..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"This will be useful..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Hmm, the trinkets of men..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This is worthy of me..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"I can use this..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_01"	"You shouldn't have threatened my kin..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_02"	"You will not prevail!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_03"	"I'll wash your filth from my claws."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_04"	"You should have run."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_05"	"Perhaps your kin will weep for you."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_06"	"I was born to the hunt. You never had a chance."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_07"	"No one will miss you."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_08"	"Your remains will be a warning to all..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_09"	"I'll tear out your throat!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_10"	"Pathetic."
"DCG_VO_ursa_use_include_01"	"<i>roars</i>"
"DCG_VO_ursa_use_include_02"	"FACE ME!!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_use_include_03"	"I'll rip you apart!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_01"	"I'll peel you from your armor, Keen..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_02"	"I'll devour you whole, ugly Keen."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_03"	"I'll break your little toys, Keen. And then you."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_04"	"I'll follow the Red Mist to glorious battle..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_05"	"They take your lands? We take their lives."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_06"	"Your armor will not save you..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_07"	"I do not grant permission to walk these woods, Traxex."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_08"	"Why do you betray me, Enchantress?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_09"	"The forest is brighter with you, Aiushtha."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_10"	"You're an abomination Lycan..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_11"	"No one subjugates my friends!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_12"	"Your hunt is sacred Warrunner, I respect that..."

"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_10"	"You don't need to follow Lady Anshu, let me show you a better way..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_11"	"Of course you won't heal me... the selfishness of the Rumusque knows no bounds..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_12"	"I'll fight by your side... for now."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_13"	"I look forward to Lady Anshu discovering your remains..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_14"	"Death to the Rumusque!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_15"	"I won't rest until your whole order is destroyed..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_16"	"Bring the dead to me, child."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_17"	"You stumbled into a way to feed me power..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_18"	"Show them no quarter, Commander..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_19"	"I will help you cut a swath through the rebellion."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_unique_20"	"Oh I haven't donned these in quite some time..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_healed_02"	"How nice..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_healed_03"	"Thank you..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_healed_04"	"Still I stand..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_healed_05"	"I'll remember this..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_01"	"I bring misery and death..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_02"	"Fall before me..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_03"	"There is no mercy, only death..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_04"	"Kill them all!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_05"	"Bring that tower down!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_06"	"Tear down the Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_07"	"Rip them a part!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_08"	"We cannot fail!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_09"	"You have no idea what you're up against..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_taunt_generic_10"	"I will know victory..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_potential_kill_01"	"I can feel your heart failing..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_potential_kill_02"	"It won't be long now..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_potential_kill_03"	"Soon..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_potential_kill_04"	"I have you right where I want you."

"DCG_VO_necrophos_potential_save_05"	"You'll never kill me!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_armor_01"	"I need more protection."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_armor_02"	"Let the battle rage on..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_armor_03"	"I will stand, while the others die..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_armor_04"	"I need to outlast my enemies..."

"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_attack_03"	"My blade is honed."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_attack_04"	"My maledictions are ready..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_attack_05"	"Good... good..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_health_01"	"Perfection."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_health_02"	"Stronger by the moment."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_health_03"	"I'm ready to spread my pestilence..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_health_04"	"I feel... invigorated....."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_permanent_health_05"	"I'm so much stronger now..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_01"	"My will is unparalleled."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_02"	"I spread my poison..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_03"	"The contagion flows through me...."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_04"	"See how my influence spreads...."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_05"	"I'm willing to do whatever it takes..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_06"	"I can't wait to see what happens next..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_07"	"I'll take any advantage..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_08"	"It's time to gather our forces..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_09"	"I'll do whatever it takes."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_cast_spell_10"	"Lets see what I have to work with..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_01"	"Take this."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_02"	"Perhaps I can be of some assistance..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_03"	"I think you needed this..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_04"	"We're in this together..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_05"	"I can't have you die on me yet..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_06"	"Take it. It's a gift."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_07"	"I'll inspire you to greatness"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_08"	"Heed my counsel..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_09"	"We need to be at our best."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_10"	"Allow me."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_01"	"You grow weaker by the moment."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_02"	"Soon you will succumb."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_03"	"You can't resist me."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_04"	"You'll crumble before me..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_05"	"I'll leave you a broken husk."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_06"	"Wither."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_07"	"I want to see you suffer."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_08"	"You will endure tremendous suffering."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_09"	"I'm going to enjoy toying with you..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_debuff_enemy_10"	"I'll break you down, piece by piece..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_01"	"Die!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_02"	"Face me!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_03"	"This is the end..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_04"	"You won't survive..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_05"	"There's no defense against this..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_06"	"You can't stop the inevitable..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_07"	"Oh this is going to be fun..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_08"	"It's the simple things that bring me joy..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_09"	"You won't be suffering for long..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_10"	"Your life belongs to me..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_01"	"So many people to kill..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_02"	"Ohhhh you have friends..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_03"	"It's nice to have options."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_04"	"I'm going to slaughter your friends..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_05"	"Watch as your friends die..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_06"	"Stand helpless while I kill your friends."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_07"	"You'll all be dead soon enough..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_08"	"Who to start with first..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_09"	"So many choices..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_10"	"Decisions, decisions..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_01"	"I'll slaughter you all!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_02"	"No one survives!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_03"	"I'll kill the lot of you!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_04"	"I'll kill your entire army!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_05"	"This is going to be a massacre..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_06"	"I'll rend your flesh!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_07"	"They won't recognize your bodies..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_08"	"Such heroics... such futile heroics..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_09"	"You will feel pain immeasurable!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_10"	"You'll all share in the agony!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_01"	"This couldn't be going better...."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_02"	"How delightful..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_03"	"I like it when things go my way.."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_04"	"Let's see how this pans out..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_05"	"As I planned..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_06"	"Interesting..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_07"	"This could be compelling..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_08"	"This is just the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_09"	"Oh such wonderful things I have in store..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_10"	"And to think this is only the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_01"	"Hmmm..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_02"	"I don't like this..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_03"	"This isn't going as I planned..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_04"	"I didn't escape the Rumusque only to die here..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_05"	"This can't be how it ends..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_06"	"I won't let this be the end."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_07"	"How did this happen!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_08"	"This can't be happening!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_09"	"Unbelievable!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_10"	"I need help!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_01"	"Damn you!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_02"	"HOW DARE YOU!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_03"	"You will suffer!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_04"	"I'll make you pay!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_05"	"This is where you die..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_06"	"I reap what I want."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_07"	"You won't deny me..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_08"	"Nothing will save you!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_09"	"I'm going to enjoy killing you."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_10"	"You will beg for me to kill you..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_01"	"Who could resist me?"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_02"	"Who would dare try to stop us..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_03"	"Victory is a foregone conclusion..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_04"	"I wish you could see the look on your face..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_05"	"I won't know failure..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_06"	"Anyone who opposes us will die."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_07"	"We have no equals..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_08"	"I was hoping you'd be a challenge. Pity."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_09"	"Pathetic."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_10"	"Useless worm."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_01"	"Have I got a surprise for you..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_02"	"I hope you enjoy..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_03"	"I've learned much over the years..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_04"	"I have some friends I'd like to introduce you too..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_05"	"I will do whatever it takes."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_06"	"No price is too high for victory."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_07"	"The pursuit of power is all that matters."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_08"	"I relish in your misery..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_09"	"I hope you weep."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_10"	"I will fill you with sorrow."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_intro"	"I'm not oblivious to my reputation. I won't even pretend that it's un-earned. I've lead the Red Mist from town to town taking whatever it is we want... and what we want is to survive. So yes. I am a warlord. I have done and will do unspeakable things. But make no mistake, I am no conqueror.  I am the Savior of the Oglodi. It's just an unfortunate reality that my people's salvation means your people's destruction."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_assault_ladders_intro"	"There is no city so secure that it's out of the Red Mist's reach. Anything is possible given enough preparation."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_burn_it_all_intro"	"The reason the Red Mist stays mobile is simple. If you have no home, it can never be razed."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_assured_destruction_intro"	"The difference between victory and defeat is the willingness to make unconscionable choices and sacrifice everything."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_bitter_enemies_part1"	"Look around you Commander... This is what awaits your beloved Stonehall."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_bitter_enemies_part3"	"You have a high opinion of yourself."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_forward_charge"	"There is a time for tactics, and there is a time for conviction. "
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_trebuchets"	"I almost feel sorry for Tresdin, were it not for Rix, her little ambush may have worked. But in the end, the Bronze Legion cannot wage a two front war. "
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"I'll kill our enemies."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"No one can match my skill."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I'll tear them apart."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Ready for war."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I will lead the charge."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I won't die today."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_02"	"I'll need this for the war to come."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I won't last without this."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Let them come."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_05"	"No one will defeat me."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"I'll take whatever they throw at me."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"I know how to use this."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Just what I needed."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This'll give me the edge I need."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"They wont have a chance."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_01"	"All who oppose the Red Mist will die!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_02"	"You never had a chance."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_03"	"My victory is at hand!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_04"	"You aren't my equal."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_05"	"The Red Mist will not be denied!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_06"	"Fear me!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_07"	"Die!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_08"	"No one fights the Red Mist and live!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_09"	"You're what passes for a warrior around here?"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_10"	"I'll leave you broken."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_use_include_01"	"Tear the tower down!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_use_include_02"	"No tower is impregnable."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_use_include_03"	"Leave nothing but ash and rubble!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_01"	"Tresdin! This ends today."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_02"	"I don't care about Roseleaf Rix, it's Stonehall I'm after"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_03"	"It's not personal Rix, Roseleaf is between us and Stonehall."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_04"	"The horde marches!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_05"	"We are the future of the Oglodi!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_06"	"Follow my lead Axe - you might learn something."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_07"	"Welcome home, Mogul"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_08"	"With my mind and your brawn - no one will stop us."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_09"	"Submit to the one true Khan."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_10"	"I should have known you'd be too stupid to run, Axe."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_11"	"You betrayed the Red Mist Axe, and now you'll answer for it."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_12"	"I'm not stronger than you Axe. But I'm way smarter."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_13"	"Stonehall will fall! It's only a matter of time!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_14"	"Death to the bronze legion!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_15"	"This alliance won't last long."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_16"	"That tower wont stand forever!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_17"	"Begin the siege!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_18"	"Set up the siege engines!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_19"	"Burn it to the ground!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_20"	"Burn it all!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_02"	"Thank you."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_03"	"I needed that."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_04"	"I appreciate the help."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_05"	"You've eared yourself a favor."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_01"	"Charge!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_02"	"Destroy the enemy tower!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_03"	"Crush our enemies!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_04"	"Bring glory for the Red Mist!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_05"	"This is ours for the taking!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_06"	"No one can stop us!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_07"	"Kill them all!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_08"	"Don't stop until they're dead"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_09"	"No survivors!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_10"	"You dare oppose the horde?!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_01"	"You're going to die."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_02"	"You won't deny me victory."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_03"	"You won't survive."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_04"	"I'll bring you down."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_05"	"You won't escape me!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_01"	"You'll have to try harder than that."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_02"	"You think you can outwit me?"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_03"	"This isn't over yet."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_04"	"You're not as clever as you thought."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_05"	"You've met your match."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_01"	"I'll fight through anything."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_02"	"I feel no pain."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_03"	"Let's see them try to kill me now."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_04"	"I need to be ready for the Bronze Legion"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_05"	"My will is unbreakable."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_attack_01"	"Need to keep training."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_attack_02"	"I feel more powerful."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_attack_03"	"I'll fight anyone."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_attack_04"	"My body needs to be as strong as my mind."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_attack_05"	"I'll show I'm stronger than Axe."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_health_01"	"I'm a survivor."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_health_02"	"I'll survive this battle."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_health_03"	"I'll stay on the field as long as I can."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_health_04"	"I feel revitalized."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_health_05"	"I'm not afraid of taking a few hits."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_01"	"Feel the power of the Oglodi!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_02"	"Fear the Red Mist!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_03"	"Follow my orders."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_04"	"I have a plan."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_05"	"I'll do whatever it takes"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_06"	"Laughter"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_07"	"You fell into my trap."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_08"	"I always had a plan."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_09"	"I'll show you why I'm Khan."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_10"	"Are you ready to die?"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_01"	"I look after my people."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_02"	"Stand tall."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_03"	"Be proud."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_04"	"I am your Khan, and I will provide."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_05"	"Follow me to victory."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_06"	"We'll do this together."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_07"	"You're a worthy ally."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_08"	"You fight well."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_09"	"Be ready to fight."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_10"	"Together we will kill them all."

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_07"	"I anticipated this…"

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_intro"	"My feelings on the war in roseleaf are... complicated. Neither the Bronze Legion nor the Red Mist are threats to my people, and yet my cousins willingly intercede on the Vhoul's behalf. Their fondness for such frail creatures is strange to me, but none the less they call for my aid, and I am compelled to answer."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_iron_branch_protection"	"I remember when the Vhoul first made their home in Roseleaf. At the time they were not much more than feral beasts, barely worth the treants' notice. But as the generations came and went, my cousins became fascinated as they watched a culture grow before their very eyes so when the Vhoul named their city after my cousins as a sign of respect, well... that fascination turned into a sort of love. And so while the treants of Roseleaf try not to directly interfere with the goings on of the Vhoul, they always try to help from afar."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"These are grim times."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I will fight for you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"It's sad that it has come to this..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"If this is what it takes, I accept the burden."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I will do what I must."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Array me for your war."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Place upon me your protections."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Let us hope it is enough."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I will do battle."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_05"	"My every step shall shake the forest."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Ah, the unceasing cleverness of mortals."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"A curious device."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I will learn how to use this..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Perfect."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Interesting..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_01"	"Back to the dirt."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_02"	"I protect those who cannot protect themselves."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_03"	"Earth, take these bones..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_04"	"As it should be."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_05"	"Nature is rarely kind. "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_06"	"This was the consequence of your folly."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_07"	"Why didn't you flee..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_08"	"It didn't have to end this way..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_09"	"I finished the fight you started..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_10"	"Your choice was your own. "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_01"	"The deepest pleasure as always, little Traxex."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_02"	"Be careful of the company you keep Ranger, not all of them have your best interests at heart."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_03"	"Aiushtha, it is an honor. Together, let us be unstoppable."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_04"	"I'm not used to being looked after Enchantress... it's an interesting feeling."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_05"	"The keen are an affront to nature!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_06"	"From beyond the Vale of Augury, little cousins, I bring wisdom and strength."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_07"	"Young Lord Ambry, what was done to you was monstrous."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_08"	"I admire your courage, little Lord ... and what you have grown into."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_09"	"The dreams of the forest are fulfilled. See her chosen champions, united."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_10"	"You, Kanna. You are the cause of this unrest."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_11"	"There will be no peace until you are destroyed, Kanna"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_12"	"So long as you don't turn your will on my cousins we will get along just fine..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_13"	"I am not pleased that we must meet like this, Prellex."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_14"	"Why must it be this way, Prellex? Can you not see reason?"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_15"	"The sooner our partnership is over, the better..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_16"	"I won't let you butcher my people!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_17"	"The Bronze Legion is not welcome in Roseleaf!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_18"	"Your mad quest for glory ends here, little Khan of the Oglodi."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_19"	"It is here that the Red Mist falls. Soon, you shall feed the earth."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_20"	"I will protect you... your cause is my own now."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_02"	"I feel as if I am in bloom!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_03"	"Delightful."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_04"	"Ah! That's more like it."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_05"	"I am born anew."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_01"	"In time, your ancient will fall..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_02"	"All things feed the cycle, my child."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_03"	"I will bring us victory..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_04"	"You all are under my protection..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_05"	"We cannot fail!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_06"	"Who threatens here?"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_07"	"There are things at work that you can't begin to comprehend..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_08"	"Stand by my side, and be protected..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_09"	"This place is under my protection!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_10"	"We will not cower from you..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_01"	"Your death will serve a greater purpose."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_02"	"Something will grow where you fall, friend."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_03"	"The dirt may have you, and keep you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_04"	"Is this all it takes to defeat you?"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_05"	"I take no pleasure in this..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_01"	"I am protected."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_02"	"I endure."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_03"	"I don't fear you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_04"	"I was here before you. I will remain after you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_05"	"The forest is ever-shifting, never ceasing."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_01"	"Let their tide break against me. The forest does not fall."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_02"	"Let them come."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_03"	"The ironbranch will not break."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_04"	"Let's see Timbersaw try to cut me down."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_05"	"Do not seek to trifle with me."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_01"	"Tremble before the forests might."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_02"	"I shall break all those who oppose us."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_03"	"You asked for my aid...and I will provide it..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_04"	"I will scatter their armies."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_05"	"I grow stronger every day."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_01"	"I continue to endure."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_02"	"I shall stand in the last fires of this conflict, and survey the dead."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_03"	"Many have attempted to strike me down. None have prevailed."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_04"	"When this war is long forgotten, I will remain."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_05"	"Long after this age has passed, I shall endure."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_01"	"You shall have my aid."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_02"	"The forest endures, and grows."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_03"	"The power flows from root to sky."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_04"	"By the vows of my people, and all the Protectors before me."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_05"	"From beyond the Vale of Augury, I come bearing gifts..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_06"	"My power is as vast as the forest itself."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_07"	"Nature protects."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_08"	"See the strength of the world grow."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_09"	"In multitudes without number, acorns sprout into forests."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_10"	"I wrap the world in my embrace"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_01"	"I offer you this protection."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_02"	"I share in your hope."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_03"	"Share in my strength..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_04"	"The world rejoices at your strength."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_05"	"Let us share in the bounty of the world."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_06"	"Your loyalty will be rewarded."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_07"	"No thanks are required, friend."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_08"	"We can last a little longer."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_09"	"There is nothing we cannot overcome."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_10"	"Your strength is my own."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_01"	"Shrink before me."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_02"	"Let this serve as your final warning."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_03"	"I do not want to kill you. If I must, however ..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_04"	"Take heed. It is unlikely that you shall get another chance to flee."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_05"	"The path before you grows dark. Turn back now."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_06"	"Weakness spreads, from you to your allies."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_07"	"You know your path to be foolishness. To not force me to correct you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_08"	"The life you seek to take is under my protection."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_09"	"What mad arrogance sets you against me? "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_10"	"Stop, and consider. This can only end in tragedy for you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_01"	"A taste of things to come."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_02"	"Sometimes a protector must become a destroyer."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_03"	"This is about survival..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_04"	"If you force my hand, I will take your life."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_05"	"You don't belong here."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_06"	"You will be broken."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_07"	"Perhaps I need to teach you another lesson."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_08"	"If you continue to test me, it shall grow worse."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_09"	"I am not pleased with your foolishness."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_10"	"I won't back down."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_01"	"Now, all of you have felt my wrath."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_02"	"It was folly coming here..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_03"	"You're parasites."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_04"	"Begone!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_05"	"The numbers don't matter..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_06"	"I will face you all..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_07"	"Let the pain educate you, let your misery be a tutor."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_08"	"You had marked me as an easy target?"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_09"	"War is an ugly thing, but it will be over soon."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_10"	"You could have avoided this."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_01"	"All of you chose this."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_02"	"A grove shall sprout where this army once stood."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_03"	"I will remember you, when the forest has reclaimed this battlefield."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_04"	"LEAVE!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_05"	"You are all on the losing side of this conflict."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_06"	"I imagine you are regretting your choices now..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_07"	"It didn't have to be this way."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_08"	"As your comrades fall, consider the price of your madness."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_09"	"You threw your lives away..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_10"	"The world will go on without you. Emptier, but richer."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_01"	"The seasons shift, and I with them."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_02"	"Ah! What loveliness."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_03"	"What a lovely day..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_04"	"Surprises are rare. Pleasant surprises, more so."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_05"	"This pleases me..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_06"	"I never tire of moments like these..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_07"	"Intriguing..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_08"	"May this moment never end..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_09"	"Such delight comes but rarely..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_pleased_10"	"It's a good day..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_01"	"I can't give in to despair."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_02"	"This was not the dream I hoped for."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_03"	"I find myself filled with regret."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_04"	"Why has it come to this."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_05"	"Perhaps my death was inevitable..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_06"	"I won't die in vain."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_07"	"How are we losing?"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_08"	"If I fall, who will protect the forest?"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_09"	"Everything I love is turning to ash."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_concerned_10"	"If this is the end, I die leaving a better world than the one I found."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_angry_01"	"We cannot break!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_angry_02"	"Make them pay!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_angry_03"	"You will die!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_angry_04"	"You have no idea what you have done..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_angry_05"	"Test your strength against me, and discover your limits."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_angry_06"	"When a protector marches to war, the world trembles..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_angry_07"	"I will grind you to dust..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_angry_08"	"All your dreams end today. "

"DCG_VO_prellex_intro"	"Brothers and sisters, The Ancient is coming. With every passing day my visions grow stronger: A violet sky. A sundered moon. And an Ancient voice that whispers 'Prepare for my arrival.' Prepare. Such a simple word that does no justice to the work that lies before us... We must be heralds; walking testimonies to the benevolence of The Ancient. Spreading the word of its glorious arrival, no matter if that message is received with joy or scorn. We must be architects; building not just this monastery for those who believe what I have seen, but an entire world that is worthy of the Ancient's splendor. We must be zealots; willing to lay down our lives in defense of this sacred space, because rest assured we are at war. Kanna and her heretics will stop at nothing to undo the work that we've accomplished, and that is why we must return in kind. "

"DCG_VO_sniper_intro"	"For too long the Keenfolk have been fractured. Little colonies spread across the world each coveting their own research... But as we kept to our workshops the world around us changed. Stonehall rose to power. The nation of Revtel was born. The Quorum of Weeping Rose grew bolder... and what did we do? We toiled and tinkered. We built wondrous machines and used them for petty tasks. This cannot continue.  The Keenfolk clans need to unite, and show the world what we're capable of."
"DCG_VO_sniper_assassinate"	"Don't get me wrong I'm impressed with what these young Keen are able to dream up, but lasers and robots take away the artistry of killing a man. In my day you had to have skill and patience to assassinate someone at range. Now they just set off an explosion."
"DCG_VO_sniper_hip_fire"	"I may be old, but my reflexes are as sharp as ever. Unless I skipped my nap, in which case my reflexes are significantly less sharp."
"DCG_VO_sniper_keenfolk_turret"	"They're not particularly mobile, but they do the job when it comes to defending your workshop."
"DCG_VO_sniper_remote_detonation"	"The purist in me hates how much Techies rely on explosives... But you can't deny they're effective."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_01"	"Peekaboo."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_02"	"Bye-bye."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_03"	"You won't feel a thing."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_04"	"They're in my sights."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_05"	"Leave this to me..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"They're not ready for me."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I'll take on anyone!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"No one messes with the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Just what I was looking for."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Good... I don't like getting killed."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Safety first."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I need to be ready for anything."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I'm no good to us dead."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_05"	"The less I get hurt the better."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"This will come in handy."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Oh I like this..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Perfect for the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"What will they think of next..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Exactly what I wanted..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_01"	"You're in my sights."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_02"	"Nothing can save you..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_03"	"No target escapes me."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_04"	"I never miss."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_05"	"You never had a chance against me..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_06"	"I seeeeee youuuu...."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_07"	"You're dead."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_08"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_09"	"I'm the greatest marksman of all time..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_10"	"At least it was quick."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_include_01"	"No one is beyond my reach."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_include_02"	"There's no one I can't kill."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_include_03"	"They never saw it coming."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_01"	"Alright Timbersaw, let's get to work."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_02"	"Build me a laser Tinker."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_03"	"Build me a robot Mazzie."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_04"	"No one can stand against the ingenuity of the Keen!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_05"	"You're ruining the Keen's reputation, Rizzrack!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_06"	"I want, that laser."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_07"	"Ahhh I see how it is, you're all jealous of my genius!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_08"	"Hello old friend..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_09"	"You're not half the marksman I am."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_10"	"Your antiquated weapon won't save you Traxex..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_11"	"Timbersaw was right to cut your people down..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_12"	"Come Timbersaw... let's show them what progress feels like..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_13"	"We're sorry Mazzie, you should have fell in line."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_14"	"You could have joined us, Mazzie..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_15"	"This almost feels like cheating. Not enough not to use it, but close."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_16"	"Oh I'm going to have fun with this..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_17"	"Perfect...more guns..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_18"	"Giddy laughter"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_19"	"Think you could get the drop on me?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_20"	"I always strike first..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_02"	"Thanks."
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_03"	"Just what I need."
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_04"	"Back in the fight."
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_05"	"I was getting worried..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_01"	"They won't last long."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_02"	"Victory is assured."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_03"	"How can they stop us now?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_04"	"If we stay focused we'll win this."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_05"	"Give me something else to shoot..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_06"	"No one is a match for the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_07"	"This is our fight to lose."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_08"	"Oh look, they brought swords to a gun fight."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_09"	"I'll prove I'm the best."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_10"	"Destroy the Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_01"	"You're mine."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_02"	"Start begging whenever you want..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_03"	"It's almost over."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_04"	"Don't worry, you'll be dead soon enough."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_05"	"Enjoy your last moments..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_01"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_02"	"Nothing equals Keenfolk ingenuity..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_03"	"You think I didn't have a plan?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_04"	"You didn't think you were winning did you?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_05"	"It's not over yet..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_01"	"Good plan."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_02"	"If I'm going to be on the front lines I need to be prepared..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_03"	"Getting tougher..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_04"	"Who needs Timbersaws' little robot..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_05"	"Ready for war."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_01"	"Let's shoot people."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_02"	"I'm always sharpening my skills."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_03"	"My aim is only getting better."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_04"	"More lethal by the moment...."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_05"	"Lets go hunting."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_01"	"I'm heartier than I look."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_02"	"I'm not going anywhere..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_03"	"No one's killing me..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_04"	"Let's seem 'em try to hurt me..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_05"	"Better safe than sorry..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_01"	"I've thought of everything..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_02"	"How do you plan to deal with this?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_03"	"You've fallen into my trap..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_04"	"You're out of options."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_05"	"Never mess with the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_06"	"The Keen aren't so easily tricked."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_07"	"Let me show you something new I cooked up..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_08"	"Behold the power of the Keenfolk."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_09"	"I'm ready for every eventuality."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_10"	"My turn..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_01"	"Here you go..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_02"	"A gift from the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_03"	"Enjoy it."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_04"	"We work well together, yes?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_05"	"Take this!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_06"	"We're in this together."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_07"	"We're going to win this."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_08"	"You'll need this!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_09"	"You're no good to me dead."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_10"	"It pays to have a Keen as your ally, eh?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_01"	"What's a matter?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_02"	"Not so scary any more, are you?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_03"	"Right where I want you..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_04"	"You weren't ready for this."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_05"	"First I line them up..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_06"	"It's the beginning of the end, for you..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_07"	"Oh I'm just getting started..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_08"	"It's ok, I'll put you out of your misery soon enough..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_09"	"Coming here was your biggest mistake..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_10"	"You'll live long enough to watch your friends die..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_01"	"Taking the shot."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_02"	"I got 'em."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_03"	"Taking aim."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_04"	"I got you now."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_05"	"I love target practice."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_06"	"Spotted."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_07"	"Bang."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_08"	"Let's see if you survive this..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_09"	"A gift from me to you."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_10"	"You won't live to strike me."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_01"	"Like fish in a barrel..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_02"	"Covering fire!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_03"	"I have enough ammo for all of you!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_04"	"Now isn't the time for precision."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_05"	"Time to take 'em out."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_06"	"Suppressing fire!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_07"	"I don't care how many of you there are!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_08"	"I got something for each of you!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_09"	"Time for some trick shooting."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_10"	"I'll take on all of you!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_01"	"You're all dead!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_02"	"Hahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_03"	"Dance!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_04"	"Watch a professional do his thing..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_05"	"NO ONE IS MY EQUAL!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_06"	"No one gets the drop on the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_07"	"Dance... DANCE!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_08"	"Boom."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_09"	"There's no where to hide!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_10"	"This is where you die!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_01"	"Well done."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_02"	"Exquisite."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_03"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_04"	"Delightful."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_05"	"The construction is excellent."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_06"	"Not bad."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_07"	"Impressive."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_08"	"Couldn't have done it better."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_09"	"Excellent."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_10"	"As intended..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_01"	"I didn't account for this."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_02"	"This isn't going as planned."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_03"	"This can't be happening..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_04"	"No, this can't be!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_05"	"How is this happening..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_06"	"It's all falling apart..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_07"	"There has to be a way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_08"	"It's not over yet, I just have to think..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_09"	"Oh dear..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_10"	"How did I not see this coming?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_01"	"NO!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_02"	"You'll pay dearly!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_03"	"Feel my wrath..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_04"	"I'll kill you all!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_05"	"This doesn't end here!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_06"	"I won't let you kill me!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_07"	"I won't go without a fight!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_08"	"I'm done playing games..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_09"	"This is the end..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_10"	"I'm going to take your head off..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_01"	"Who can match skill?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_02"	"Please, I'm supposed to be impressed?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_03"	"How pedestrian..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_04"	"You think a marksman of my skill can be denied?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_05"	"I welcome a challenge."
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_06"	"Oh look, a 'challenge', how quaint."
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_07"	"Swords and armor? Please."
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_08"	"I'll punch a hole through any armor."
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_09"	"You actually thought you could win didn't you?"

"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_01"	"Time is running out..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_02"	"All roads led to this moment..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_03"	"When the Keen stand together, nothing can stop us..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_04"	"The Keen didn't seek out war, we just perfected it."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_05"	"I have something special in store for you."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_06"	"Here's a new trick I've been working on..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_07"	"Perhaps you're not familiar with what the Keen are capable of."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_08"	"I'm looking forward to killing a god..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_09"	"Science will always beat magic."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_10"	"Iron Fog is an inspiration to us all..."

"DCG_VO_pugna_intro"	"The Tyler Estate. It seeks to control magic. Punish those that violate rules set by the Quorum. But I will show them that some things cannot be controlled. And when the Tyler Estate burns, I will set my sights on Weeping Rose itself."

"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Darkness advances."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_equip_generic_armor_05"	"With this, the Devourer is arrayed for conflict..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Ah, yes. Of course."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"What a useful trinket."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Curious tools for such dark tidings."

"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_unique_11"	"I arrive at your behest, but this is beyond your control."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_unique_12"	"I cannot aid you. Perhaps it is best to die."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_unique_13"	"Your daughter is right. Time to die, crone."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_unique_14"	"I suspect you could have lived. Were you not a fool."

"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_cast_spell_07"	"It has come to this. Sad."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_cast_spell_08"	"In elder times, it was foreseen ... and drove the prophets mad."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_cast_spell_09"	"What a mockery of your foolishness."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_cast_spell_10"	"Beyond this point, the prophesies are vague. That is not a good sign."

"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_buff_ally_06"	"It is foreseen, this shall give you some small comfort."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_buff_ally_07"	"I look after my friends..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_buff_ally_08"	"I'm glad to be of assistance..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_buff_ally_09"	"I shall require you to live a little longer."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_buff_ally_10"	"It is not yet your time. Stand up and fight."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_01"	"Worse to come."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_02"	"Embrace your weakness."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_03"	"Do not fight it."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_04"	"It will all be over soon."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_05"	"Feel your sanity slip away."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_06"	"Existence is painful enough."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_07"	"The Abyss is calling you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_08"	"You grow more frail..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_09"	"Why did you foolishly hope for better?"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_debuff_enemy_10"	"Sssh. Let the darkness take you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_01"	"The Devourer's shadow covers you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_02"	"Enough with you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_03"	"I warned you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_04"	"That is the sound of you breaking."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_05"	"Feel the life ebb from you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_06"	"This pain will be the last thing you feel."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_07"	"Your suffering is mundane."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_08"	"Nothing about your agony is special."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_09"	"These are your last moments."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_single_target_damage_10"	"Your single moment of glory is to die before me."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_01"	"All of you are shattering as I rise."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_02"	"I'll kill all of you!"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_03"	"Nothingness awaits you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_04"	"I usher you in to the darkness."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_05"	"By my hand and will, the void claims you all."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_06"	"Unworthy though you may be, kneel now and accept your fate."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_07"	"The end is come."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_08"	"Nothing is lost, for none of you ever mattered."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_09"	"When the end comes for me, I won't even remember you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_small_10"	"Cease your weeping. Screams are more befitting to such an occasion."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_01"	"You glimpse the end now, do you not?"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_02"	"Such devastation."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_03"	"Break. Break beneath me."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_04"	"All things shatter to ash & dust."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_05"	"Feel yourself tearing to splinters."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_06"	"All of you are dead."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_07"	"Such a waste."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_08"	"Like broken toys and torn ragdolls."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_09"	"See the scattered remnants of what you once loved."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_multi_damage_large_10"	"This. This shall be your final warning."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_01"	"Yes. Yes. As foretold."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_02"	"Very well."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_03"	"Pleasing."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_04"	"This does not disappoint."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_05"	"I accept these results."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_06"	"Satisfactory."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_07"	"I expected far worse."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_08"	"How pleasant."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_09"	"Oh how delightful..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_pleased_10"	"Now this is amusing..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_01"	"I should have seen this coming."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_02"	"What foolishness has led us here?"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_03"	"Had I but known ..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_04"	"This is, perhaps, the end."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_05"	"It has come to this. As expected."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_06"	"This will not be my fate..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_07"	"With clear eyes, I face the inevitable."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_08"	"I've squandered so much."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_09"	"Grief, I feel you wash over me."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_concerned_10"	"And soon enough, even this shall be forgotten."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_01"	"How dare you!"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_02"	"Your madness knows no bounds."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_03"	"You disappoint me..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_04"	"I will kill you for this."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_05"	"I am called the Devourer, fool. Let me show you why."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_06"	"You shall not live to see the end."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_07"	"Angering me was a most foolish choice."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_08"	"You shall find neither mercy nor pity. "
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_09"	"The omens favor war. A shame, for you."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_angry_10"	"The beat of my wings presages your end."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_01"	"What hope have you? What foolish, stupid hope?"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_02"	"Do you imagine yourself victorious? How?"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_03"	"Throw yourself on your sword, and save us all some time."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_04"	"You actually believe you can still win?"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_05"	"I am prepared to face the end of all things. Are you?"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_06"	"You cannot defeat what you cannot comprehend, fool."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_07"	"Surrender."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_08"	"You have failed against me. It was inevitable."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_09"	"I have seen stars die, worlds end and civilizations collapse."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_10"	"Watching hope fade from your eyes was beautiful"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_01"	"This is your destiny..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_02"	"I will do my part..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_03"	"This is my gift to you..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_04"	"You have no idea what awaits you..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_05"	"I will change the world..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_06"	"Come my minions..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_07"	"This is just the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_08"	"So much more is coming..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_09"	"Your lives are mine to toy with..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_enigmatic_10"	"You've barely seen what I am capable of..."
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_death_01"	"<i>Screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_intro"	"Something is stirring in Roseleaf. I'm not referring to Stonehall's war machine, or the Red Mist Horde... no... those are problems of flesh and blood, distractions keeping attention divided from the real danger. The Court of Ristul. But I cannot face this danger alone, and so I hope to meet with Luna of the Dark Moon. With the combined might of Selemene and the All Seeing One, we may have a chance."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_allseeing_ones_favor"	"Once I doubted my faith; but no longer. The All Seeing One has chosen me to be it's champion and I will not let the Omniscience down."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_divine_intervention"	"The All Seeing One will never forsake his agents."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_divine_purpose"	"My god gave me purpose. A holy mission. Until this geas is completed I will not know defeat."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_selemenes_favor"	"Lead by Luna, the Dark Moon worship Selemene, goddess of magic and the moon. To underestimate their power is to court disaster."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_use_ability_01"	"Receive the All Seeing One's blessing."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_use_ability_02"	"By my hand you are saved."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_use_ability_03"	"The mercy of the Omniscience be upon you..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_use_ability_04"	"The battle isn't over yet my friend..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_use_ability_05"	"I won't abandon you."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Ready for the crusade..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I shall enter the fray."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I will bring light and fury..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"The heretics will fall."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I will fight and I will win."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I must be prepared..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_armor_02"	"The battle will be long..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Our cause is just, and we must prepare..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I will stand at the front..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Today is not my day to die."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"This will protect me."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"This will see me through the battle."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"My thanks."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"I'll use this well."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"This will help."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_01"	"Fall before the light of the Omniscience."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_02"	"I smite you!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_03"	"May the All Seeing One bear witness!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_04"	"Be at peace, wretched fool."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_05"	"I'll send you to your god!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_06"	"Bow before the All Seeing One's light!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_07"	"Fall!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_08"	"I fear no heretic..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_09"	"There is no eluding judgment. "
"DCG_VO_omniknight_kill_rival_10"	"I will root out the unjust..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_use_include_01"	"May the wings of the Omniscience enfold us."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_use_include_02"	"The Omniscience loves & watches-over us all."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_use_include_03"	"Great protector, gaze down upon us and guard us well."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_01"	"A gift from the All Seeing One itself."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_02"	"These are dire times Luna, we must work together."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_03"	"The Court of Ristul has made it's presence known... we must respond in kind."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_04"	"I don't answer to Stonehall..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_05"	"I don't fear godless savages..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_06"	"I'm not your enemy Rix, you're blinded by hate."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_07"	"The All Seeing One has sent me to watch over you, Rix. Be not afraid."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_08"	"No one dies on our watch..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_09"	"I cannot assure the vhoul victory, but I'll do what I can."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_10"	"False & unwholesome god, I am honored to strike you down."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_11"	"We have to look after each other..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_12"	"Together we can destroy the court of Ristul!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_13"	"Selemene has lended us her aid..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_14"	"You're using children to win the war, Rix?"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_15"	"You're an abomination Necrophos..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_16"	"You would have been a powerful ally, Sven."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_17"	"Sven, your dedication honors us."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_18"	"We're friends by choice, right Chen?"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_19"	"I've seen worse means of conversion, Chen"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_20"	"So THIS is what being a knight of the fold feels like..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_healed_02"	"I am purified!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_healed_03"	"All Seeing One, clear my mind!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_healed_04"	"All Seeing One, fill my heart!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_healed_05"	"Thank you."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_taunt_generic_01"	"Judgement comes!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_taunt_generic_02"	"My hammer is ready in service to the All-Knowing One."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_intro"	"It's not easy being the smartest ogre in the world. There's lots of jealous people out there. Think about how many people you know with one head. I bet it's a lot. Now realize that every single one of them is half as smart as us. Do you know how lonely it is to walk this earth, never finding an intellectual eq- we like rocks! Yes...yes we do."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_ignite"	"I think we're probably the first person to figure out that fire can be used not just to cook meat. But also light people on fire. If not the first, definitely in the top five. "
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_and_one_for_me"	"Where we come from; when an Ogre wants something, they tend just to kill whoever's holding it. But since we couldn't exactly do that, we invented a process of giving and taking items without murder. It's like sharing. But better, because we came up with it."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Oh I like this. Hey l want to hold it!"

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"It's not a rock... but it'll do."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I would really prefer if we could have two helmets"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_02"	"So long as the armor covers my half I'm happy. I heard that!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Remember, there's two of us to protect."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Oh we're ready to fight now..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_05"	"We appreciate you lookin' after us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Between the two of us we can figure out how to use this thing..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"What is it? That's a good question... let's find out."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"So do I hit people with it? No, we wear it!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Pretty!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Oh we're gonna have fun with this little bauble ..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_01"	"Hahahahaha!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_02"	"Not very impressive."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_03"	"I smashed you good!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_04"	"You're not good enough to stop us"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_05"	"I killed you! No I did! No I did!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_06"	"Hahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_07"	"Two heads are better than that bleeding thing where your head...used...to...I'm sorry this got away from me."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_08"	"We're unstoppable!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_09"	"Got you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_10"	"Too easy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_01"	"Burn... BURN!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_02"	"Let's show 'em what we can do. Sounds good to me..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_03"	"My favorite part is when we light everything on fire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_01"	"Follow me brother..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_02"	"Follow your magi to battle!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_03"	"I think I'd like working for the Bronze Legion. No. No we wouldn't."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_04"	"Don't get any ideas, we're not joining the Legion. Well I might. Please don't."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_05"	"See what did I tell ya, the Bronze Legion treats Ogre's fairly!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_06"	"Let's see how far you can throw this guy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_07"	"Aww there's no one to throw..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_08"	"The Bronze Legion enslaved you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_09"	"I'm sorry brother..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_10"	"We don't like doing this, but you gave us no choice..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_11"	"You'll pay for what you did to our people! What he said!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_12"	"I like your hair."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_13"	"I like your hair."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_14"	"Don't worry Kanna, I'll convince this one to join the Dire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_15"	"You sure we can trust her? Would I lie to you?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_16"	"Don't worry Prellex, I'll convince this one to join the Radiant..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_17"	"You sure we can trust her? Would I lie to you?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_18"	"We saw what the legion has done- well he saw, I was asleep, the point is that we're with you Rix"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_19"	"The loud mouth says that you have the right of things, Rix..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_20"	"If we help you here... then you help us free our people next..."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_02"	"Thanks."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_03"	"Thanks."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_04"	"We needed that."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_05"	"I feel better... me too!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_01"	"Just leave this to us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_02"	"Don't worry, we have a plan - I have a plan, that's what I said..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_03"	"You're not walkin' away from here..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_04"	"I'll knock down that tower..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_05"	"Leave the ancient to us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_06"	"You think you can take on both of us?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_07"	"You ready to fight? Yes sir I am, I was talkin' to them..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_08"	"Don't worry friends, Ogre Magi is here..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_09"	"We won't lose!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_10"	"Just leave this to me... and me! Leave it to me too!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_01"	"Nononono"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_02"	"I don't think so."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_03"	"Think you can outsmart us?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_04"	"Smash you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_05"	"Crush you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_01"	"We've thought of everything!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_02"	"We're not like the stupid ogres, you can't trick us!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_03"	"I don't think I wanna die today..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_04"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_05"	"Didn't expect that, did you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_01"	"Who's tougher than us? Nobody!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_02"	"We're not dying today..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_03"	"I think I like this feeling..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_04"	"Way to toughen up..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_05"	"They won't kill us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_01"	"I feel stronger..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_02"	"I'm stronger now..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_03"	"Who's stronger than us? Nobody!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_04"	"Who want's to fight? Me! Me!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_05"	"Let's pick a fight..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_01"	"We need to take care of ourselves..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_02"	"A little safety precaution never hurt..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_03"	"They think they can kill us? Ha!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_04"	"How do I look? Like you're ready for war..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_05"	"I'm ready to fight..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_cast_spell_01"	"Look what we can do..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_cast_spell_02"	"Hope this works, of course it will work."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_cast_spell_06"	"Time to show 'em what we can do..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_cast_spell_07"	"We brought some friends along..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_cast_spell_08"	"We need help!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_cast_spell_09"	"I think it's time we called some friends. I agree."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_cast_spell_10"	"They actually think they're winning, don't they..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_01"	"Here you go..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_02"	"What are friends for..."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_02"	"You don't look so good."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_03"	"Easier to smash..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_04"	"Did you think we didn't have a plan?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_05"	"You can't outsmart us! Well maybe you Sure, but not you."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_03"	"If we don't die here it'll be great to catch up..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_04"	"It's always nice to spend time with the Treants..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_05"	"Traxex; I'm not here to help Kanna, I'm here to protect you from her."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_06"	"Oh we're going to work great together, I can tell..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_13"	"The Oglodi have a home, leave the vhoul to theirs!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_14"	"Take your horde home Sorla, while you still can..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_15"	"The keen would defile this place..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_16"	"Leave the trees alone Timbersaw."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_17"	"I don't know what you did to her Kanna, but I'll free Traxex from you"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_18"	"I feel... strange..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_19"	"I was a fool to doubt your power Kanna..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_20"	"Galanius doesn’t need Roseleaf Tresdin, let the Vhoul go..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_healed_01"	"Ahhh"

"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_07"	"Weren't expecting this, were you?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_08"	"We're just getting started..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_02"	"I can take these guys..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_03"	"The numbers don't matter..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_04"	"I don't care how many of you there are.."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_05"	"We'll stand our ground!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_06"	"There's not enough of you to stop us..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_07"	"It'll take a lot more than you guys to stop us..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_08"	"I bet right now you wish you had better friends..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_09"	"This is our forest!"

"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_05"	"I think this is going to work out..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_07"	"This is a good start..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_08"	"I feel like singing, I mean I won't do it, but the sentiment remains..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_09"	"What a lovely day..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_10"	"That's nice."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_01"	"Oh dear..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_02"	"This is troubling..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_03"	"I don't know about this..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_06"	"I can't fail now..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_07"	"We've come so far... we can't give up..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_08"	"These are dangerous times..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_09"	"How did things get so out of hand?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_10"	"It's getting hard to stay optimistic..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_01"	"How could you?!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_02"	"You think I won't fight back?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_03"	"You have a lot to answer for!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_04"	"I won't let you win!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_05"	"This will be the end of you!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_06"	"You've gone too far!"

"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_09"	"You won't leave these woods alive!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_10"	"We end this now!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_01"	"I am the Enchantress! Speaker for the living forest."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_02"	"Too easy..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_03"	"This is the army people were worried about?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_04"	"Looks like I was getting worried for nothing..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_05"	"You're not half as clever as you think you are..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_06"	"Did you think I was just a pretty face?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_07"	"You thought you were better than me?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_08"	"I'll make it as painless as I can..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_09"	"You never really had a chance...."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_03"	"There are no winners in war, only survivors..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_04"	"Perhaps some good will come of this..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_05"	"I wonder if our side is in the right."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_06"	"If you won't listen to reason, I have no choice..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_07"	"I'll make you listen to reason..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_08"	"Nature works in mysterious ways..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_09"	"We all have our parts to play, don't we..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_10"	"The forest will reclaim you..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_intro"	"My existence shouldn't be. I was not born of a mother, but from a rock...and yet I was carved by no artisan. No... I willed my consciousness into being.  For so long, I walked alone... confused... but that all changed when I met Kanna. I was rudderless, and she gave me direction. I was ignorant of the ways of man, and she gave me understanding. I was alone in this world, and she gave me companionship.  But above all, she gave me a name and sense of self. Once I called myself Raigor Stonehoof...but she has given me a new name that is far more fitting... Earthshaker."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_echo_slam"	"Prellex is raising an army to destroy her daughter, but I won't allow that to happen. Let them come in droves... no one will get past me."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Ready for battle."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I need to protect myself..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_armor_02"	"flesh is so weak..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I won't foolishly rush to battle."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_11"	"You will be crushed under the weight of your own war machine, Kanna...."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_07"	"You think you can challenge me?"

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_01"	"Hmmmm"

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_05"	"How dare you!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_06"	"This is madness!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_07"	"You brought this on yourself!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_08"	"You'll pay for that!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_09"	"I will grind your body to dust..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_10"	"I'll bury you in the earth..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_01"	"Who dare oppose me?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_02"	"Pathetic..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_03"	"I was expecting a challenge..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_04"	"This is no test of my skill..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_05"	"I could crush you with the wave of my hand..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_06"	"Yield now, and spare yourself the humiliation..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_07"	"There's no shame in admitting you're outmatched..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_08"	"You were never my equal."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_09"	"This was over from the moment you walked on the battlefield..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_10"	"Do I need to remind you who I am?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_01"	"The drum of war beats loudly..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_02"	"I am elemental earth made flesh."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_03"	"The power of the earth itself courses through me..."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_05"	"No one is my equal..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_06"	"You're about to behold something wondrous and terrible..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_07"	"My totem calls to me..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_08"	"That drum you hear is the sound of your undoing..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_09"	"Better to die on this battlefield than to live as a rock..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_10"	"My soul is unbreakable..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_death_01"	"<i>Screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_intro"	"Power is a funny thing. It's something we all want but are taught to be ashamed to seek. But power is neither good nor evil. It's freedom, It's the ability to live the life you choose, on the terms that you want. People like to criticize where that power came from but in time, history forgets... and only remembers what you chose to do with it. People can judge me for helping Kanna. But in time they will understand."
"DCG_VO_drow_avernus_blessing_new"	"If Abaddon isn't willing to share the Mist of Avernus, I'll just have to find a way to take it."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_friendly_fire"	"Friends always let you down."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_grazing_shot"	"Listen I'm not saying Wind Ranger is a bad shot, I'm saying she's an aggressively mediocre shot."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_gust"	"Never take victory for granted... the moment you assume there's nothing an enemy can do to stop you, is the moment you're most likely to lose."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_juke"	"I've lived a long as I have because I always stay mobile..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Just what I needed..."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"There's nothing I can't hunt."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I think I can make this work..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I'd run if I were you..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I'm not leaving the battlefield..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Good, I want to be around as long as I can."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Smart investment."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_03"	"It's not personal."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_04"	"You were never leaving this place."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_05"	"You never should have came here."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_06"	"No one is my equal."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_07"	"There's no shame in dying to the best."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_08"	"It was inevitable."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_09"	"Let's see that twerp Wind Ranger do that..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_10"	"Too easy."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_01"	"I don't think so..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_02"	"Be silent."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_03"	"No more tricks."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_01"	"At least you'll die with a smile on your face."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_02"	"You're a zealot Prellex..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_03"	"You've gone too far, Kanna..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_04"	"I love working with you Rooftrellen..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_05"	"This is my time of triumph, not yours..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_06"	"Oh no you don't!"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_07"	"I'm not taking any chances..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_08"	"I'm not going to wait and find out what you had planned..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_09"	"A deal's a deal Kanna, just remember to hold up your end of the bargain."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_10"	"You have power Kanna, I can respect that..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_11"	"I'll help, but don't expect me to worship a rock anytime soon..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_12"	"So long as you don’t expect me to go to your little temple we'll get along just fine."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_13"	"You are a freakishly cheerful woman Rylai..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_14"	"It's not a bow, but it's close enough."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_15"	"I think its time I call a few friends..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_16"	"I'll lead you to victory..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_17"	"Stick with me and well win this in no time..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_18"	"I'm sorry about what happened to your family Lycan..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_19"	"The longer you can keep me alive the better"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_20"	"Keep me safe Rooftrellen, I have work to do..."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_01"	"Leave this to me...."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_02"	"This won't take long..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_03"	"They're really going to hate me..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_04"	"They know we're a threat.."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_05"	"Don't get cocky."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_06"	"This is our battle to lose."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_07"	"This is going to be fun..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_08"	"We have them right were we want them..."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_kill_05"	"Don't worry, it'll be a clean death."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_01"	"You really thought you could kill me?"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_02"	"You're not in my league."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_03"	"Nice try."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_04"	"Not today."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_05"	"I'm not dying today."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_01"	"I needed this."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_02"	"They won't be ready for this..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_03"	"I fear no one."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_04"	"Ready to fight."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_05"	"I'm standing my ground."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_attack_01"	"My aim is true."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_attack_02"	"Our enemies will regret coming here."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_attack_03"	"No one can escape my bow."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_attack_04"	"Time to hunt larger game..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_attack_05"	"My enemies will weep..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_health_01"	"Such power..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_health_02"	"I feel...invigorated..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_health_03"	"Just as I planned..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_health_04"	"I needed that..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_health_05"	"No one's killing me..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_01"	"I always have a plan..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_02"	"There's a solution to any problem..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_03"	"It's adorable that you think you can win..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_04"	"Do don't know who you're messing with do you?"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_05"	"Sometimes the subtle approach works best..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_06"	"There's a reason I'm a legend..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_07"	"It's wise to fear me."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_08"	"Don't be scared, it'll all be over soon."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_cast_spell_09"	"Not so fast."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_01"	"Not so impressive now are you?"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_02"	"Oh, what's a matter?"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_03"	"Let me cut you down to size..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_04"	"You were a lot scarier before..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_05"	"You don't scare me."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_06"	"I've hunted bigger."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_07"	"This is just the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_08"	"I'm coming for you."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_09"	"First I hobble you, then I kill you."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_debuff_enemy_10"	"Tick tock..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_single_target_damage_01"	"You're dead."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_single_target_damage_03"	"I always hit my mark."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_single_target_damage_04"	"I won't stop until you're dead."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_single_target_damage_05"	"You're not leaving this place alive."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_single_target_damage_06"	"I've killed better."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_single_target_damage_07"	"There's more where that came from."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_single_target_damage_08"	"I'll put you down."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_multi_damage_small_04"	"We can chip away at them!"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_multi_damage_small_05"	"Let's see Wind Ranger do that!"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_multi_damage_small_06"	"Let me show you what I can do..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_multi_damage_small_07"	"Let the arrows fall!"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_multi_damage_small_08"	"I'll whittle them down."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_multi_damage_small_09"	"Just give me a little time..."

"DCG_VO_bristleback_cast_spell_10"	"I'm full of surprises..."
"DCG_VO_bristleback_death_01"	"<i>Screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_intro"	"Every year the Marrowfell Centaurs send their bravest warriors into Roseleaf to hunt Thunderhides... to them this gruesome safari is a right of passage, but I will not let these majestic creatures be hunted for sport. The only question that remains is how many centaurs will I have to kill before they realize Roseleaf Forest is no longer their hunting grounds."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_loyal_beast"	"This forest has been my home for many years... and its denizens are quick to come to my aid."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_primal_roar"	"I've seen many hunters in my day. Each one bold. And strong. And fearless. Fearless that is, until they realize they're not the Apex Predator... and then they run like the cowards they are."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_use_ability_01"	"To me old friend..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_use_ability_02"	"The jungle will protect me..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_use_ability_03"	"You think I travel alone?"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_use_ability_04"	"<i>Sharp whistle</i>"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_use_ability_05"	"The jungle protects it's own."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"I'll wield this well..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I'll keep this jungle safe..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I'll make quick work of our enemies..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Trespassers will be punished..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"This jungle is under my protection..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_armor_01"	"These are dangerous times..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_armor_02"	"I'm a survivor..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_armor_03"	"This is what I needed."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I'll need this..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_armor_05"	"A wise investment ..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"This will get me through the battle..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Perfect."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Just what I was looking for..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"I'll make use of this."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Just what I needed."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_01"	"You should have left this place."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_02"	"This is my dominion."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_03"	"You don't belong here..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_04"	"I'll leave your corpse for the beasts..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_05"	"You're going to rot here..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_06"	"Crossing my path was your last mistake..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_07"	"You brought this on yourself..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_08"	"A fitting end..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_09"	"You were never going to win..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_kill_rival_10"	"I am the Apex Predator..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_use_include_01"	"<i>Mighty roar</i>"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_use_include_02"	"Begone!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_use_include_03"	"LEAVE THIS PLACE!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_01"	"We'll win this war together, old friend..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_02"	"Lycan, your wolves are under my protection..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_03"	"Our beasts will feast on their bones..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_04"	"Your hunt ends today..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_05"	"Your hunting days are over..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_06"	"Lets see how tough you Centaurs really are..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_07"	"Protect this forest Prellex, and my loyalty is yours..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_08"	"Together we will protect the forest..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_09"	"Your little abomination is an affront to nature Timbersaw..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_10"	"Alright Bradwarden... if we're to fight together we do it on my terms..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_11"	"When this is over we have unfinished business, Warrunner...."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_12"	"I never thought I'd be fighting side by side with centaurs..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_13"	"I think it's time to call on my friends..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_14"	"There's no place for Marrowfell here!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_15"	"You chose the wrong place to hunt..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_16"	"Get out of my jungle!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_17"	"Run from me, Coward!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_18"	"Time for us to end this!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_19"	"A detestable weapon, but necessary."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_unique_20"	"Don't worry old friend...you're safe."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_healed_02"	"Thank you"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_healed_03"	"You're owed a great debt."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_healed_04"	"My thanks."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_healed_05"	"Much appreciated."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_01"	"Ready to fight."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_02"	"They are the prey..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_03"	"The hunters become the hunted..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_04"	"The children of this jungle are under my protection!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_05"	"Yield and you'll all be spared..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_06"	"Destroy the ancient!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_07"	"Destroy the tower!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_08"	"You have no chance against us!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_09"	"You're not leaving this jungle..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_taunt_generic_10"	"The woods are a dangerous place to get lost in..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_kill_01"	"I'll make it quick."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_kill_02"	"It'll be a clean death."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_kill_03"	"No mercy for trespassers..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_kill_04"	"Don't you get it? I'm toying with you..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_kill_05"	"At least you made me work for it..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_save_01"	"I don't think so..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_save_02"	"I'm too cunning to die..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_save_03"	"You can't defeat me here..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_save_04"	"The jungle won't let me die..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_potential_save_05"	"I'm harder to kill than you think..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_armor_01"	"There's no one I won't face..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_armor_02"	"The forest has made me... resilient..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_armor_03"	"I don't fear the hunter's arrow..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_armor_04"	"Let the centaurs come..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_armor_05"	"I won't be dying anytime soon."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_attack_01"	"My axes are sharper..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_attack_02"	"My instincts are honed..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_attack_03"	"The blood of my enemies will run..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_attack_04"	"I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty.."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_attack_05"	"Ready to get up close and personal..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_health_01"	"Tougher than a thunderhide..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_health_02"	"The jungle has forged me into the man I am today..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_health_03"	"I can survive anything..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_health_04"	"These calloused hands are ready to work..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_permanent_health_05"	"I have weathered many storms... I'll survive this one as well..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_01"	"Witness the power of the jungle..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_02"	"You will harm the forest no more!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_03"	"I won't let you despoil this place!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_04"	"You're never leaving this place."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_05"	"In this place I am sovereign..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_06"	"The denizens of the jungle heed my call."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_07"	"I have a few tricks up my sleeve..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_08"	"You think I don't know how to fight?"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_09"	"I can adapt to any situation..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_cast_spell_10"	"I'm always a step ahead..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_01"	"We cannot fail!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_02"	"We will not lose!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_03"	"Now is our time!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_04"	"Stand tall my friend!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_05"	"We can do this together!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_06"	"Feel the strength of the jungle!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_07"	"I will lead you to glory..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_08"	"Let me toughen you up..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_09"	"You can learn much from me..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_buff_ally_10"	"Nature taught me to survive..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_01"	"You're not fit for this savage place..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_02"	"It's ok to be scared..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_03"	"Don't be frightened, you won't be alive much longer..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_04"	"I'm toying with my prey..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_05"	"You will suffer!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_06"	"You're pathetic...."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_07"	"You're outmatched..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_08"	"You never had a chance..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_09"	"Look at you... a shell of your former self..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_debuff_enemy_10"	"I'll make short work of you..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_01"	"Time to die!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_02"	"Show me what you're made of!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_03"	"I'll tear them apart!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_04"	"The forest will claim you..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_05"	"You survived beasts to get here... but you won't survive me..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_06"	"The beasts will feed on your corpse..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_07"	"Face me!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_08"	"I'll do this myself!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_09"	"You will know what it is to feel pain..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_single_target_damage_10"	"Your blood will water the land..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_01"	"You look lost..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_02"	"Death to trespassers!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_03"	"You despoil this place!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_04"	"More meat for the beasts..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_05"	"Numbers don't frighten me.."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_06"	"A handful of thugs? No worries."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_07"	"I can deal with this lot myself..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_08"	"I don't need help to take on this lot..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_09"	"My blades always find their mark..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_small_10"	"I'll handle this mob..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_01"	"This is our time!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_02"	"Now is our moment!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_03"	"Leave no one standing!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_04"	"I'LL KILL YOU ALL!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_05"	"WITNESS MY FURY!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_06"	"I'll show you the meaning of savage..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_07"	"None of you are walking away..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_08"	"It's all over!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_09"	"DEATH TO OUR ENEMIES!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_multi_damage_large_10"	"I didn't start this fight... but I will end it."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_01"	"Hmmm"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_02"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_03"	"Well done!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_04"	"Nicely done..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_05"	"I can work with this..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_06"	"Not half bad..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_07"	"We have a chance!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_08"	"We must seize the opportunity!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_09"	"Just as I planned..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_10"	"Hahaha"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_01"	"Hmmm"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_02"	"This is not ideal..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_03"	"This requires a delicate hand. I'm bad at delicate things."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_04"	"We need to find a way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_05"	"Damn, I can't kill my way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_06"	"This isn't going so well..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_07"	"This isn't exactly what I planned..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_08"	"Troubling..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_09"	"We need to find a solution..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_10"	"This isn't working..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_01"	"Damn it!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_02"	"How dare you!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_03"	"You'll pay!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_04"	"You'll regret doing that..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_05"	"You have my attention now..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_06"	"This ends here!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_07"	"You're an abomination!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_08"	"You're dead!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_09"	"I'll leave you broken..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_10"	"I'll make you suffer!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_01"	"Come face me!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_02"	"Ill take you all on!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_03"	"Who among you dares face me?"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_04"	"I have no equals!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_05"	"Pathetic..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_06"	"That's your best effort?"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_07"	"Be grateful I found you before my beasts ate you alive..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_08"	"The civilized world has nothing to offer me.."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_09"	"'Civilized'... please, you're more savage than I am..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_10"	"At least I'm honest about my hatred of people."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_enigmatic_01"	"The laws of the jungle are harsh and unbending..."

"DCG_VO_viper_intro"	"Once Pugna used me. Controlled me. Owned me. Eventually I escaped, and while at first I relished in my newfound freedom, as years passed it became a more hollow existence... for a while I thought this ennui came because my tormentor still roamed free, and I wouldn't find peace until I make him suffer as I did. But after I began my quest for vengeance I came to a realization. Pugna is not an abnormality. How many dabble in magic to summon and control. To create life then force it to obey. No. Pugna's enslavement won't bring me peace... but enslaving every wizard? Now that is something that will help me sleep well at night."
"DCG_VO_viper_viper_strike"	"In time, all things will die... I just like to do my part to speed up the process."
"DCG_VO_viper_corrosive_mist"	"I am able to thrive in... less hospitable environs."
"DCG_VO_viper_intimidation"	"Pugna taught me to savor every delicious moment before the kill."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"A fine choice, to augment my fangs."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"They shall flee before me ... and die nonetheless."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"A weapon befitting me"

"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_04"	"This will do well..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_05"	"They won't be able to kill me..."

"DCG_VO_viper_unique_01"	"Do not speak to me, foul little thing."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_02"	"This is a temporary alliance wizard."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_03"	"After this battle we will settle unfinished business."

"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_05"	"This isn't possible!"
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_06"	"How could this happen?"
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_07"	"I can't let myself be captured..."

"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_09"	"I've escaped bondage, I can escape this..."
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_10"	"I need to be cautious..."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_01"	"I will blight the land!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_02"	"You will not find mercy here!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_03"	"I will watch you burn!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_04"	"I will laugh as you suffer!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_05"	"My poison will creep through your army..."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_06"	"I will eat your simmering corpse..."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_07"	"You will be my slave."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_08"	"I will see you weep on your knees."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_09"	"You dare anger me?!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_10"	"I want to see you beg."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_01"	"I can feel your terror from here..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_02"	"Give yourself to me, and I will grant you mercy."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_03"	"What chance do you have?"
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_04"	"Do try to make your death memorable..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_05"	"Bow before the Netherdrake..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_06"	"I won't rest until my menagerie is teaming with sorcerers..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_07"	"I'm your god now..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_08"	"Have you another army you could call to your aid?"
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_09"	"You live as long as it amuses me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_10"	"The power of the Nether courses through my veins..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_01"	"I learned much from that sadist..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_02"	"I shall return to the Nether Reaches as a conquering king..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_03"	"I move unhindered..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_04"	"You're not cunning enough to stop me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_05"	"I don't think so..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_06"	"I can adapt to any situation..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_07"	"One sorcerer shall bow to me. And then another. And then ten-thousand and more."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_08"	"I know no limits."

"DCG_VO_rix_intro"	"I was conscripted to the Bronze Legion when I was a pup. They marched through my village with their shiny armor and promises of glory and I couldn't sign on fast enough. I smiled when they put the conscript mark on my arm cause I knew that if I worked hard enough, if I followed orders, if I showed valor and skill in battle I would make something of myself and become more than just a stupid savage from Redmaw. And so I followed. and fought. and killed. And with every town we occupied, every insurrection we quelled, every voice of dissent I silenced, the words 'for the glory of Stonehall' grew hollower, and that bronzed mark I took pride in became heavier. So now we march through Roseleaf to intercept the Red Mist Horde, and again my Commander has asked me to 'speak to my savage people'... well speak to them I shall... and when I do, they'll understand that I will fight beside them until every soldier is sent back to Stonehall in a bronzed coffin."
"DCG_VO_rix_truth_to_power_intro"	"The powerful would have the weak be silent. To accept the status quo. To bend the knee. To accept their lot in life. For too long I was complicit in Stonehall's grab for power. It ends today. I will be a voice for my people, and I will not be silenced."
"DCG_VO_rix_act_of_defiance_intro"	"I'll never forget the first day of the rebellion. Tresdin sent me to collect rations from the farmers of Roseleaf - supplies in case the Red Mist siege would be prolonged... but it was a lean year for those farmers. I reported what they could spare, but Tresdin decided it wasn't enough, and so she instructed her thugs to take what they needed by force...after all, 'it was for their own good.' Well when her people arrived they didn't find cowering farmers. They found an army that I will lead until my dying day.  The men, women and pups of Roseleaf deserve to live their lives free of Stonehall's grip. And while the price of their freedom will be blood, it is a price we are all willing to pay. "
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"This'll do."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I can work with this."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Time to carve up some legionnaires."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Ready to fight."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Ready for battle."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Better safe than sorry."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_02"	"A general can't afford to die on the field."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_03"	"They may kill me, but I'll make 'em work for it."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I'll give the Legion something to fear."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_05"	"This should make me last a little longer."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Time to make their lives hell."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"They'll never wear me down."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"If I'm to lead, I need to look the part."

"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_04"	"We will never bend the knee!"
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_05"	"Time to die."
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_06"	"Your death will be an example to others."
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_07"	"I fear no man or beast."
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_08"	"I don't fear death. You on the other hand..."

"DCG_VO_rix_unique_10"	"Hm, the enemy of my enemy, eh Sorla?"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_11"	"Today we're united against a common threat."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_12"	"We can work together, Sorla - we both want Tresdin dead."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_13"	"Neither of us want Roseleaf to fall to these savages."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_14"	"The Red Mist must be stopped, even if that means working with you."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_15"	"We can kill each other later - first let's stop The Red Mist."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_16"	"Your tyranny ends now!"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_17"	"You gave your last order Commander."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_18"	"Silence, Sorla!"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_19"	"You're done leading, Sorla."

"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_armor_03"	"The legion has armor, so should I."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_armor_04"	"I need to be ready for Tresdin."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_armor_05"	"Tresdin is going to call me out - I need to be prepared."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_attack_01"	"Getting stronger."

"DCG_VO_tinker_intro"	"The idea of working with Mazzie is...less exciting to me. But Sniper has raised some excellent points: The Keen have been divided for too long and at least he doesn't yell at trees. Still, it's hard for me to overlook our past. Do I think we'll be friends? No. Do I think I can stomach his presence and not 'accidently' shoot in him the back of the head? Maybe if I drink enough. Time will tell."
"DCG_VO_tinker_keenfolk_golem"	"Mazzie is horrible at lots of things. Being dependable. Staying sober. Keeping secrets. But I'll give him credit: he knows how to build a giant robot. "
"DCG_VO_tinker_march_of_the_machines"	"Every Keenfolk has a pet obsession. Sniper likes shooting things. Timbersaw cuts down trees. I develop fun and exciting ways to kill Mazzie. Some might frown at my attempted murder, but if I never developed these drones, he never would have built his robot suit to hide in.  So really, he should be thanking me."
"DCG_VO_tinker_steam_cannon"	"Sniper asked me to design him a gun. I got over excited."
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_ability_01"	"Who needs magic?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_ability_02"	"Behold the power of science!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_ability_03"	"Target locked..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I'll take what I can get..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I can work with this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Yeah...this'll kill someone."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I feel safer already..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_02"	"I can't invent if I'm dead..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I'm not dying today..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Better safe than sorry..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"An interesting device..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Now how does this work...."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Interesting...."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"A new toy to play with..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_03"	"Who's next?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_04"	"Any other challengers?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_05"	"This was the only way things were going to end..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_06"	"This is my battlefield!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_07"	"No one matches my brains, or my firepower...."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_08"	"You shoulda begged for mercy..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_09"	"One less target to worry about..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_10"	"Let's see sniper do better..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_include_01"	"March! March! March!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_include_02"	"I cooked up something special just for you..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_include_03"	"My machines will tear you apart!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_01"	"You are a remarkably old man Sniper. Why has your heart not given out?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_02"	"Laser is charged."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_03"	"Weapon's primed."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_04"	"Laser's back online."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_05"	"You're weapon may be dated, but your vision is forward thinking..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_06"	"You're right Sniper, the Keen need to stick together."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_07"	"Alright Mazzie, I'm willing to forget about the past..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_08"	"Mazzie, we're coworkers, not friends..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_09"	"Stop worrying about the trees and stay focused on the battle!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_10"	"I know you're excited but please watch where you swing those saws?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_11"	"Thank God Mazzie isn't here..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_12"	"Thanks for bringing us together Sniper...."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_13"	"Oh great. We're all together. With Mazzie. Yay."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_14"	"Together the Keen are unstoppable!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_15"	"Mazzie, you're about to give your life for science."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_16"	"I'm going to pry you out of that tin can!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_17"	"You can't hide in that thing forever, Mazzie!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_18"	"Axe. Meet laser."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_19"	"A gun that shoots bullets. Wow you're old."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_20"	"You're a maniac Rizzrack, I was a fool to think I could work with you!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_02"	"Good"
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_03"	"I was getting worried"
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_04"	"Ready to get back to work..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_05"	"Back in the fight..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_01"	"Follow my orders and we'll win!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_02"	"We can take the tower!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_03"	"The Ancient is exposed!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_04"	"Destroy that tower!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_05"	"Bring the Ancient down!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_06"	"We have them where we want them!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_07"	"Momentum is on our side!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_08"	"If we keep it up, we're sure to win!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_09"	"Our enemies can't stop us now!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_10"	"Soon no one will be in our way!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_01"	"You're dead man walking..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_02"	"There's no way you survive this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_03"	"You know what's about to happen, don't you."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_04"	"Bye bye..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_05"	"I won't lie: this is gonna hurt."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_01"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_02"	"Nice try!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_03"	"You thought that would work?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_04"	"You have no idea what I'm capable of!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_05"	"I've gotten out of worse jams..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_01"	"This will keep me in the fight..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_02"	"A little extra protection never hurt..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_03"	"I need to be ready for anything..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_04"	"These are dangerous times..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_05"	"I'll show Mazzie how to properly armor something..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_01"	"Time to tune my instruments..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_02"	"I always maintain my machines..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_03"	"Time for an upgrade..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_04"	"Bigger and better!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_05"	"Warfare is my specialty..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_01"	"Better than ever..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_02"	"It's important to account for one's weakness..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_03"	"Never stop improving things... even yourself..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_04"	"There's always a way to make something more perfect!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_05"	"Unlike Sniper, I care about my self..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_01"	"Enjoy..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_02"	"Hope you're ready for this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_03"	"I plan ahead..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_04"	"I always play the long game..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_05"	"Don't undervalue long term investments..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_06"	"It's not magic, it's science!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_07"	"It's ok to be impressed..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_08"	"This is something I've been working on for a while..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_09"	"What will I think of next?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_10"	"Another example of Keenfolk ingenuity..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_01"	"Here you go..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_02"	"You're lucky you have a genius as a colleague..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_03"	"Let me help you out..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_04"	"It looks like you could use this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_05"	"I have your back."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_06"	"You can be my test subject..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_07"	"Let me make life a little easier for you..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_08"	"I'm always ready to experiment, I mean help, my friends."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_09"	"I think you'll be pleased with the results..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_10"	"Let me give you a hand..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_01"	"This is working better than expected..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_02"	"That can't feel good."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_03"	"Don't worry, you won't be suffering for much longer..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_04"	"You're living on borrowed time..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_05"	"How much longer before that kills you..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_06"	"I'm going to have fun with this one..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_07"	"You're nothing but a shell of what you used to be..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_08"	"It's debilitating isn't it..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_09"	"You're growing weaker by the moment..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_10"	"You used to be so strong... and then I plotted your death."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_01"	"I got 'em."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_02"	"Leave this to me."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_03"	"Pathetic."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_04"	"There's no one beyond my reach!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_05"	"Please, you think I'm scared of you?"

"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_07"	"Goodbye."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_08"	"So long."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_09"	"You're in my sights..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_10"	"This isn't going to end well for you."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_01"	"A minor nuisance, nothing more..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_02"	"Boom."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_03"	"There's no hiding from me."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_04"	"I can kill anyone I want."

"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_06"	"Oh look, there's a lot of you...how impressive..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_05"	"Science demands sacrifice..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_06"	"I engineered this whole thing!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_07"	"Behold my brilliance!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_08"	"Don't worry, you're all going to die!"

"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_01"	"Hmmm."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_02"	"I don't know about this."

The morals are lose, but their contracts are fair; whenever I took a job from The Brass Herald, Lord Sunbreeze, or Kwerthias I knew they'd make good.

"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_single_target_damage_06"	"Watch a professional work."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_single_target_damage_07"	"You picked the wrong fight, friend."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_single_target_damage_08"	"Get out of my way!"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_single_target_damage_09"	"You asked for this."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_single_target_damage_10"	"I'm just finishing what you started."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_small_01"	"You're all dead!"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_small_02"	"I'll take 'em out."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_small_03"	"This'll be quick..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_small_04"	"I'll deal with these runts."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_small_05"	"My turn."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_small_06"	"I got a little surprise for you..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_small_07"	"You guys are just outmatched."

"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_small_10"	"You shoulda stayed home..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_large_01"	"Sticking around was a bad decision."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_large_02"	"You're dead."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_multi_damage_large_03"	"No one's walking away from here!"

"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_pleased_08"	"It's practically gift wrapped..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_pleased_09"	"I couldn't have planned this any better..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_pleased_10"	"Doors open."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_01"	"This is bad..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_02"	"Nononono"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_03"	"How did this happen."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_04"	"This job just got harder..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_05"	"Why can't I catch a break..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_06"	"Why did I take this job..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_07"	"I knew this was a mistake..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_08"	"I got too cocky..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_09"	"I lost focus..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_10"	"I need to stay calm..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_01"	"I'm done playing games."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_02"	"No more running!"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_03"	"I'm putting you in the dirt"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_04"	"I'm takin' you out!"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_05"	"You brought this on yourself...."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_06"	"We could have done it the easy way..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_07"	"You wanna make this difficult? Fine!"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_08"	"I was gonna let you die with some dignity..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_09"	"That was a big mistake..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_10"	"I'm gonna make you pay..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_01"	"I always finish a job."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_02"	"There's no job I can't finish."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_03"	"I'll take any bounty for the right price..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_04"	"I'm the best."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_05"	"Too easy."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_06"	"What did you expect to happen..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_07"	"Of course we're winning..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_08"	"You're just outclassed."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_09"	"There was no way you were going to survive."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_10"	"Try and keep up."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_01"	"I've seen things you would not believe..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_02"	"Nothing's impossible..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_03"	"With enough planning you can do anything..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_04"	"Let's hope this works..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_05"	"It's a long shot."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_06"	"We only got one chance..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_07"	"I'm not letting you get away..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_08"	"I'll do whatever it takes..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_09"	"End of the line."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_10"	"Hahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_intro"	"I know they think I'm crazy... and that's ok... they didn't see what I saw... see what the trees did. 'Ohh it nature, look at the beauty of the forest.' Lies. That's not a tranquil jungle... that's a sleeping army. And unless we are prepared when that forest starts to march it will be the end of everybody."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_raze"	"Sometimes I think Sniper doesn't really want to be my friend, he just wants me on his side so I won't destroy everything he loves."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_smash_their_defenses"	"Everyone likes to think they build things that last, but if you give the Keen enough time, we'll figure out how to destroy anything."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_whirling_death"	"I was nervous about following the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk to Roseleaf... Sniper had a lot of rules. Rules like 'we can't stop to cut down every tree'. But when he saw the Treants marching towards us, he quickly made an exception."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"I can always make some improvements..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"The saw suit needed this..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"A weapon, good...good..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Yes...this is what I needed."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"When the trees come, I'll be ready."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Let's see them hurt me now!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_02"	"My suit is impregnable!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I'm ready to fight..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I'm ready for the front lines..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Just give me someone to cut..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"This will be useful..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Interesting..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I'm looking forward to using this..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This will work nicely."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Perfect."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_01"	"Die!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_02"	"You never had a chance!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_03"	"Yes... YES!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_04"	"You were always going to die here..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_05"	"You thought you could beat me?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_06"	"There's more where that came from..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_07"	"I could do this all day..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_08"	"Who's next!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_09"	"Bring on the next one!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_10"	"I'm not done, yet..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_01"	"Spin! Cut! Shred!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_02"	"Hahahahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_03"	"I'll cut you down to size..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_01"	"You're obnoxious and sanctimonious but you have excellent taste in wine."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_02"	"They all hate us Mazzie, but that's ok... we got robots."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_03"	"Alright Mazzie...lets get into trouble..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_04"	"Try to leave some for me Sniper..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_05"	"You're a visionary Sniper, together we will unite the Keen."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_06"	"Leave the trees to me, Sniper..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_07"	"You know what we need to do Tinker... put more robots inside robots..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_08"	"I've always wanted to work with you Tinker"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_09"	"What do you make of Snipers plans to unite the Keen?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_10"	"With the Keen united what can't we do?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_11"	"It feels good to fight with my cousins..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_12"	"What sort of games are you up to Treant..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_13"	"This is a temporary alliance tree man."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_14"	"I know what you're plotting tree man...but it's not going to work.... I see through you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_15"	"I won't stop still I cut all of you down!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_16"	"I'll cut you in half!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_17"	"I won't stop until the Vale of Augury is razed!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_18"	"I'm going to destroy your little toy..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_19"	"You squandered all of your talent Mazzie..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_20"	"You think you built a better robot than me?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_02"	"I needed to make some repairs..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_03"	"Thank you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_04"	"I needed that..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_05"	"I was in trouble..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_01"	"Cut them down!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_02"	"Leave no one standing!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_03"	"Smash the Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_04"	"Destroy the tower!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_05"	"Raze it all!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_06"	"We won't lose!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_07"	"This is our chance!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_08"	"We will destroy anyone who gets in our way!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_09"	"Let's finish this!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_10"	"We can't lose!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_01"	"I have you now..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_02"	"It's only a matter of time"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_03"	"You're about to dieeeeeeee"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_04"	"You see what's coming don't you...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_05"	"Here comes the murder...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_01"	"Uh, uh, Uhhhhh"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_02"	"Close, but not good enough..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_03"	"I don't think so."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_04"	"I've thought of everything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_05"	"You wont kill me..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_01"	"Time to reinforce the ol' saw suit...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_02"	"I think some improvements are in order..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_03"	"Let me replate this thing."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_04"	"It's stronger now, good."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_05"	"I need to be ready for the trees...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_01"	"Sharper than ever..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_02"	"I can always use some new blades..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_03"	"I can cut through almost anything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_04"	"Now bring me a tree man..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_05"	"I cant wait to test these new blades out..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_01"	"I can't just rely on the saw suit..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_02"	"They're coming to kill me... and I need to be ready..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_03"	"Let's see those trees come after me now..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_04"	"You can't kill me trees, you hear that? YOU CANT KILL ME!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_05"	"I'll be ready to fight."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_01"	"Time for a little Keenfolk insight..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_02"	"Were you counting on this."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_03"	"Let's see you deal with this!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_04"	"Not so fast!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_05"	"I love this part..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_06"	"Let me show you what this thing can really do..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_07"	"I built this thing to take on anything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_08"	"They'll never forget the name Rizzrack..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_09"	"I am the greatest inventor of our time!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_10"	"There's nothing I can't do..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_01"	"I built this for you."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_02"	"Here you go."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_03"	"You need to be ready... the trees are plotting..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_04"	"Together we'll stop them..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_05"	"Here, friend..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_06"	"You're not adequately prepared... here, let me help..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_07"	"This is what you need to defeat our enemies..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_08"	"Oh we'll show them..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_09"	"You never should have underestimated us..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_10"	"This is our moment!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_01"	"I'll whittle you down..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_02"	"Soon there will be nothing left..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_03"	"You can't stop me now!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_04"	"You're not laughing now, are you?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_05"	"Maybe now you'll start to take me seriously..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_06"	"They all understate me until its too late..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_07"	"The Keen have a plan for everything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_08"	"You can't pull on over on me..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_09"	"You won't be able to stop me!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_10"	"Look at you... so fragile..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_01"	"I got you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_02"	"I'll cut you apart!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_03"	"I'll carve my name into your body!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_04"	"I'm coming for you....."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_05"	"Who's laughing at me now?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_06"	"I'll saw you in half!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_07"	"They'll find pieces of you all over the battlefield."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_08"	"I won't be denied..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_09"	"What can I carve up next?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_10"	"Who want's to play?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_01"	"I got enough saws for everybody..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_02"	"Time to start slicing..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_03"	"So many beautiful things to destroy..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_04"	"I'll take on all comers..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_05"	"It makes no difference how many friends you brought..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_06"	"You're not leaving this place alive..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_07"	"I'm turning you to mulch..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_08"	"They wont be able to recognize your body..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_09"	"I'll leave you broken..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_10"	"I'm just getting warmed up..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_01"	"<i>Crazed laughter</i>"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_02"	"Cutcutcutcutcutcut!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_03"	"I'LL DESTROY EVERYTHING!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_04"	"I'll take you all on!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_05"	"COME ON!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_06"	"SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_07"	"I'M COMING FOR ALL OF YOU!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_08"	"You think I'm outnumbered? You think I don't have a plan?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_09"	"I'm on a roll baby!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_10"	"I will destroy everyone that stands in my way!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_01"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_02"	"Perfection."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_03"	"As designed."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_04"	"Good, good..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_05"	"Ohhhh yes...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_06"	"I need this to happen."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_07"	"All according to plan."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_08"	"Oh the trees won't like that one bit..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_09"	"Delightful!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_pleased_10"	"I'm tingling with anticipation..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_01"	"Oh nonononono."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_02"	"This can't be happening..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_03"	"This isn't supposed to happen."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_04"	"How can this be?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_05"	"What's happening?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_06"	"How did the trees orchestrate this?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_07"	"I'm... I'm losing?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_08"	"Why aren't we winning?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_09"	"How do we come back from this?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_concerned_10"	"Ok Rizzrack, think, THINK!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_01"	"HOW DARE YOU!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_02"	"I won't let you get away with this..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_03"	"You'll answer for this!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_04"	"You think you're better than me?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_05"	"You really shouldn't have made me angry..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_06"	"This is gonna hurt."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_07"	"I'm going to make you suffer..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_08"	"You work for the trees don't you!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_09"	"You'll pay for underestimating me!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_angry_10"	"You're going to be sorry very very soon..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_01"	"No one could accomplish what I've done..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_02"	"This suit is a work of genius..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_03"	"What could Oglodi barbarians make that the Keen couldn't do better..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_04"	"I destroy what I want, when I want..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_05"	"There's nothing this suit can't destroy..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_06"	"The dominance of the keen is assured!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_07"	"This just isn't your day..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_08"	"One day the Keen will rise."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_09"	"In time, there's nothing I can't do."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_10"	"You honestly think you can win, don't you?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_enigmatic_01"	"Oh you won't be laughing for long..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_enigmatic_02"	"I have something special for you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_enigmatic_03"	"Let's see what this thing can really do..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_enigmatic_04"	"This is only the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_enigmatic_05"	"I have a lot of surprises in store for you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_enigmatic_06"	"There's nothing the Keen can't devise..."

"DCG_VO_timbersaw_death_01"	"<i>Screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_intro"	"The hunt is a sacred thing, and to be asked to lead it is a great honor. These centaurs claim to be the finest hunters of the Marrowfell Tribe. We shall see if any of them are worthy to claim the Horn of the Alpha."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_double_edge"	"In battle, as in life; there are moments where you are forced to choose between greatness and security."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_hellbear_crippler"	"Any centaur worth his skinning knife can kill a hellbear. The real trick is doing it without getting scarred."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_spot_weakness"	"Anything is killable. The only question is if you can live long enough to spot it's weakness."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_spring_the_trap"	"There are no words to describe the anticipation you feel the moment before you descend on your prey."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_take_aim"	"Courage is not what makes a hunter great. It's patience."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_the_omexe_arena"	"The Omexe Arena is where I made a name for myself. I was it's champion, and no one was my equal."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_thunderhide_alpha"	"The Alpha is a fearsome beast, capable of untold destruction... only the strongest of centaurs dare to stand in it's presence, let alone fight it one on one."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_thunderhide_pack"	"When hunting Thunderhides, you always come home with new scars...if you come home at all."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Blood may now run."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"To the front of battle, I stride."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I'll claim my trophies yet."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"They will test me, and they will fall."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"It gives me strength."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Yes, this will serve."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Fit for a champion."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_armor_03"	"It will do."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Keep me alive. I'll win the glory myself."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_03"	"An artful death."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_04"	"You had no chance."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_05"	"You die so that others may cheer."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_06"	"Your name shall be forgotten."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_07"	"My path is paved with bones."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_08"	"I take my trophy..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_09"	"You fall before a champion & war chief."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_04"	"You're funny, little keen. I like you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_05"	"This is the greatest prize a centaur could ask for..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_06"	"This fight only delays my hunt, Karroch. We are not allies."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_07"	"If you would be hunted in place of the thunderhide, Karroch, say the word."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_08"	"You would die for them, Karroch? I will grant that request."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_09"	"Karroch, you of all people should appreciate the sacred hunt..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_10"	"Kill glycan's pet!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_11"	"Get rid of the wolf, we have larger prey to hunt...."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_12"	"What is this ugly little thing next to me? A shaman?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_13"	"Your toys amuse me, Mazzie."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_14"	"A gun hardly seems sporting, Sniper..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_15"	"Now!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_16"	"Strike now!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_17"	"Let's see what you hunters are made of "

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_19"	"Prove that you are worthy of the horn of the alpha"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_20"	"Make Marrowfell proud!"

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_healed_02"	"The hunt continues..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_healed_03"	"I can resume the hunt..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_healed_04"	"Ready to fight..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_healed_05"	"I'm rested and ready..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_01"	"This is my arena..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_02"	"I will stomp you into dust."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_03"	"This is my proving ground..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_04"	"I fear neither beast nor blade."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_05"	"The crowd cheers my name once more."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_06"	"Your ancient is doomed..."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_potential_kill_02"	"You become the trampled road."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_potential_kill_03"	"You won't survive..."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_attack_02"	"They cannot stop me now."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_attack_03"	"I'll run through them like a field of wheat."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_attack_04"	"Each swing will topple armies."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_attack_05"	"I cannot be defeated."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_health_01"	"My heart races wild."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_health_02"	"A war chief reborn."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_health_03"	"Old scars vanish."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_health_04"	"I am invigorated..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_health_05"	"Like the first time I stepped into the arena."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_01"	"The power of my people."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_02"	"This will aid in the hunt..."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_04"	"Let the hunt begin!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_05"	"We'll take our prey..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_06"	"The hunting horns sound!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_07"	"There are trophies to be taken."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_08"	"War will ring through the forest."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_09"	"Don't dismiss our cunning..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_10"	"Here, we make a glorious stand."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_01"	"Take strength."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_02"	"We are on them now."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_03"	"They are not champions."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_04"	"In the Omexe arena, you would make a worthy second."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_05"	"Do not show them fear."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_06"	"Their tower looms. We can take it."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_07"	"How many did they bring? Not enough."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_08"	"Run beside me. This is their end."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_09"	"You stand in the shadow of a war chief."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_10"	"The power is in you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_01"	"Are you growing weak?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_02"	"Do you see the end?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_03"	"What cowardice is in you now?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_04"	"Stand and face the end."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_05"	"Do not turn from me. Take pride in your death."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_06"	"You are wounded prey..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_07"	"To think, I had imagined this an entertaining fight."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_08"	"Are you ashamed of your weakness?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_09"	"You wouldn't survive a fight in the arena..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_10"	"You provide no entertainment at all."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_01"	"Your flesh has met my blade."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_02"	"This is but the beginning."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_03"	"My blade is heavy, it is not?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_04"	"I'll tear you in half."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_05"	"I'll carve you from this world."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_06"	"You will fall at my hooves."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_07"	"My blade will hack you limb from limb."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_08"	"Against me, you stand no chance."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_09"	"Run. You are not swift enough to escape."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_10"	"My blade will be your end."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_01"	"I'll run all of you down..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_02"	"You aren't worthy to be killed by me..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_03"	"I'll crush every last part of you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_04"	"You have not felt the blade's final bite."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_05"	"Are you growing tired? I am not."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_06"	"Oh the trophies I shall take..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_07"	"None of you will survive."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_08"	"You won't last long..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_09"	"My axe has gains another notch."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_10"	"Better creatures than you have met the same end."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_01"	"It is sad that you die so poorly."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_02"	"Pray to your weak gods."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_03"	"Death has come for you today."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_04"	"The echo of my hoof beat is the last thing you will hear."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_05"	"My axe sings, and all of you will fall."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_06"	"I faced worthier rivals in my first summer."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_07"	"All of you will break beneath my hooves."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_08"	"Feh. And here I thought I faced worthy contenders."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_09"	"Your army cannot withstand us..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_10"	"All of you are dead."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_01"	"I shall honor your name."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_02"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_03"	"Fine enough."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_04"	"It is well."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_05"	"As it should be."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_06"	"Death hides from us."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_07"	"Yes, this is fitting."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_08"	"You have pleased me."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_pleased_10"	"It honors a champion."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_concerned_01"	"It cannot be."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_concerned_02"	"I do not believe it."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_concerned_03"	"This displeases me."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_concerned_04"	"Is this shame I feel?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_concerned_05"	"I cannot fail."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_concerned_06"	"The hunt is not over ..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_concerned_07"	"What do the crowds chant, now?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_concerned_08"	"I am not finished here. Not yet."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_angry_06"	"I'll run you down like swine!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_angry_07"	"When I'm through with you there will be nothing left to bury..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_angry_08"	"I will shatter your skull!"

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_angry_10"	"You're my prey now!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_01"	"Look at me. I am a true champion."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_02"	"My glory knows no bounds..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_03"	"I am the pride of my people..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_04"	"Only I am worthy to hold the horn of the Alpha..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_05"	"My clan has no warriors as pathetic as you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_06"	"When I run you down, I shall forget you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_07"	"You are unworthy of a warrior's death."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_08"	"You're a coward."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_09"	"This is no child's game."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_10"	"I was forged in Omexe... what threat could you prove to be?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_01"	"I will take many trophies this hunt..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_02"	"What glory sings in these hunts?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_03"	"Does the crowd remember me?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_04"	"I prepare for the hunt..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_05"	"Where does my pride lead me now?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_06"	"There's a way around any problem..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_07"	"I shall never find my equal in combat."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_08"	"They thought this would stop us?"

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_death_01"	"<i>Screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_axe_intro"	"Axe is a man of many talents. Well one talent. The murder talent. However that seems to be enough for Axe to attract a legion of devoted fans that follow his adventures. It also probably helps that Axe's bard, Goodkind is good at what she calls 'embellishment' - Axe is unsure what the word means, but it's probably a good thing."
"DCG_VO_axe_combat_training_intro"	"The ability to successfully kill someone that wants to kill you is a life skill everyone should have. Even Goodkind."
"DCG_VO_axe_berserkers_call"	"Axe doesn't look back on his time in the Red Mist with particular fondness, but he acknowledges that he learned a lot about violence. "
"DCG_VO_axe_enough_magic"	"Axe doesn't know much about magic except that you have to punch it."
"DCG_VO_axe_grand_melee"	"You can always judge a bar by the quality of the fights that break out. So when looking for a place to drink at, try to find one where the blood is stained into the wood. That's the Axe seal of approval"
"DCG_VO_axe_sucker_punch"	"There are few things more annoying than fighting a cat man that makes copies of himself. Every time you think you kill the last one, there's always another one behind you."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Oh Axe can kill some people with this..."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"This'll work jusssst fine."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Oh Axe likes this."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Time to hurt some people."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Axe is ready to fight."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Generally Axe likes to show is chiseled physique, but very well."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Goodkind will appreciate Axe being practical."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Axe is not a scholar like Goodkind... but Axe is smart enough to know that being stabbed is bad."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Excellent."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_05"	"This is what Axe needed."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Axessories make the man."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Axe will make good use of this."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Thank you."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Great."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Axe needed this."
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_01"	"Of course Axe will kill you."
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_02"	"No one is stronger than Axe"
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_03"	"This battlefield belongs to Axe"
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_04"	"Goodkind is going to write about this..."
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_05"	"Where's a real challenge?"
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_06"	"Axe will crush the ancient soon enough."
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_07"	"Axe will cut down anything in his way"
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_08"	"You think you can stop Axe?"
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_09"	"Axe fears no one!"
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_10"	"Axe wants a real challenge!"
"DCG_VO_axe_use_include_01"	"Axe will kill you all!"
"DCG_VO_axe_use_include_02"	"Come and get it!"
"DCG_VO_axe_use_include_03"	"Come to Axe!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_01"	"Finally, a real fight."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_02"	"Nice to fight something that doesn't die right away."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_03"	"This'll be a good fight."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_04"	"Let Axe show ya how to murder."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_05"	"Axe can show you a thing or two about violence."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_06"	"Let's work on your technique."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_07"	"So you're a Khan now Sorla... impressive."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_08"	"You're smarter than Axe, but you'll never be stronger."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_09"	"If you were as smart as people say you are you never would have challenged Axe."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_10"	"You're a disgrace to the Red Mist Horde?"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_11"	"Axe will send your body back to Sorla Khan!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_12"	"The Red Mist should have stayed dead!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_13"	"I'll take on your entire horde!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_14"	"Killing Red Mist is what Axe does best!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_15"	"Sweet sweet Blink Dagger."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_intro"	"Most people are content eking out an existence... eat. Work. Copulate. Sleep. This cycle continues, ad nauseum yielding useless children that are raised by their useless parents to have useless purposes in life. But I am not most people. I am a man of vision. My daughters are creations of purpose. And together we will spread a delicious poison across this countryside, purging it of weakness and stupidity."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_plague_ward"	"My daughters are beautiful in design and purpose. To see them spread their poison is a wonder to behold."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_sow_venom"	"I like to take time when placing my creations, ensuring that each of my daughters has a chance to blossom into what they are destined to become...but sometimes I'm seized with inspiration and tend to my work faster than normal."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Nothing is quite so fine as a device built for murder."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"As lovely as my daughters? No. But quite appealing, none the less."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Blood will run freely.."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_01"	"My daughters look even more stunning in your light, Luna..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_02"	"I won't let you kill my daughters!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_03"	"It delights me to see our children playing together so nicely, Prellex."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_08"	"How my lovely garden twists and drips!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_09"	"Are they not a profane delight to behold?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_10"	"Don't be afraid, my children will bring you a swift death."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_11"	"Do you long to caress my lovely prizes?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_12"	"Can you smell the sweet rot my daughters bring..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_13"	"I have much work to do..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_14"	"My daughters long to show their affection..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_15"	"Together we will do great things, great devourer..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_16"	"You were right, Kanna. This alluring garden required my tender care."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_17"	"Iron will not protect you from my children..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_18"	"This place is mine now, Thank you for preparing it for me."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_19"	"The shade of Roseleaf is soaked in blood, innocent and murderer alike. My gratitude to you."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_unique_20"	"I tend to this forest now..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_healed_02"	"Thank you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_healed_03"	"I was getting worried..."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_taunt_generic_09"	"Look at you... so proud... so foolish..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_taunt_generic_10"	"I bring death and beauty...."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_kill_01"	"On your knees!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_kill_02"	"Just give up..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_kill_03"	"You are getting tired...aren't you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_kill_04"	"Close your eyes. Feel yourself sinking into the soil."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_kill_05"	"That scratch at the back of your throat is perfectly normal."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_save_01"	"I won't leave my daughters orphaned..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_save_02"	"Who could abandon a garden such as this?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_save_03"	"Do not worry, lovelies. Father will not leave you."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_save_04"	"You will never kill me..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_potential_save_05"	"A serpent, in his garden, is difficult to catch. More difficult still, to survive."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_01"	"What vemons encircle you?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_02"	"Let me show you some tricks of the trade..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_03"	"I've learned a thing or two in my travels..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_04"	"You are not long for this world..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_05"	"Toxins slither, compound and spread."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_06"	"You'll hardly feel a thing..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_07"	"Power awaits anyone strong enough to wield it..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_08"	"You didn't think this would be easy, did you?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_09"	"You underestimated me...it's the last mistake you'll make..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_10"	"I've seen such wonderful things... let me show you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_01"	"I don't reserve ALL of my adoration for my daughters."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_03"	"Take this..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_04"	"Let me be a friend to you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_05"	"Stand beside me, darling, I'll take care of you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_06"	"I can be merciful when I wish..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_07"	"Not all my gifts are tainted..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_08"	"Take, and enjoy..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_09"	"Those who protect my daughters will be rewarded..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_buff_ally_10"	"Enjoy..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_01"	"Not all of my stings kill. Many merely debilitate."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_02"	"Savor this. The next part is simply excruciating."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_03"	"How does this make you feel?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_04"	"The agony is curious, isn't it?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_05"	"Enjoy the last sensations of life..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_06"	"Take deep, slow breaths. Count backwards from ten, if you must."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_07"	"I wouldn't scratch that if I were you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_08"	"Soon the numbness will spread..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_09"	"It burns just a bit, doesn't it?"

"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_03"	"Fascinating, isn't it?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_04"	"Listen to your body. Feel it rebel against your will?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_05"	"The pain is looping inside you, looking for a way out."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_06"	"That's death, awakening inside you."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_07"	"For you, and you alone, the most magnificent of earthly torments."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_08"	"Is the splendor too intense? The colors, are they too sharp?"

"DCG_VO_meepo_intro"	"I'm not going to lie, life's been a little rough. I was on a tear playin' the couriers in White Spire, when all of a sudden I hit a cold streak. It happens. We figure we were due for a win so we go to Momma Eeb and take out a marker. Based on past dealings, Eeb's not to keen to let us borrow the money so we give her Meepo 3 as a collateral. We go back to the track, and well- look, I can't stress enough how cold the couriers were that day. We have a team meeting and decide it's not fair that Meepo 3 gets his legs broken because a sure thing fell through. So I go the Jasper Circle and get a loan to pay Eeb and get Meepo 3 back. But now we're in it with the Jasper Circle so we really don't want to take any chances because Momma Eeb will mess you up, Lasan will straight up kill ya. So we decide to do some odd jobs for the Ravenhooks and skim enough money off the top to be able to pay back the Jasper Circle, but that's when I realize that there's no way we could get cleaned out 3 times in a row... you're smart people, I think you can figure out where this is going. So mistakes were made and now we're back to where we started with the Jasper Circle debt only this time the Ravenhooks won't take us back because, ya know, we robbed them. We're freaking out and pointing fingers, and that's when Meepo 3 sees a wanted poster for our old friend Mireska. Now Lord Sunbreeze has put a huge bounty on his daughter that would cover the Jasper debt in spades, but A: Mireska's a friend... and more importantly B: there was no way we'd get to her before Gondar did. So I come up with a new plan. Gondar will capture Mireska. We'll free Mireska. Mireska will owe us. And Mireska will keep the Jasper Circle from killing us. It's a perfect plan. What could go wrong?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_divided_we_stand"	"I think it's important to have friends that can compensate for your weakness. For instance, I'm great at playing cards; where as meepo 2 is more of a dice guy. Does that mean we all get along? Of course not, one of us is always getting the rest of us in trouble... but at the end of the day, we always work together to find a way out... because if you can't count on yourselves... who can you count on? "
"DCG_VO_meepo_cunning_plan"	"Mireska likes the long con. Me? I like to shake things up and see what happens."

"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_03"	"It's been fun..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_04"	"I think it's time to move along..."

"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Oh yeah..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I can use this..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I can make this work..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Wow this is heavier than it looks."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I wouldn't want to be hit with this thing...."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Good, I like not dying."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_02"	"You're always thinkin' ahead..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I feel safer already."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Way to keep your top talent alive."

"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_04"	"You never had a chance against a guy like me..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_05"	"You hang out with a bunch of lowlifes you pick up a few things..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_06"	"Don't look surprised, I'm pretty great."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_07"	"Yeah, I can back it up."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_08"	"Anyone else want to try me? "

"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_04"	"God I hope this wasn't a mistake..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_05"	"It's nice to fight along side someone who really gets me, ya know."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_06"	"Gondar. Buddy. Pal. You don't wanna kill me."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_07"	"Why you got that knife out Gondar, it's just your old pal Meepo."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_08"	"Woahwoahwoah put the knife down buddy, I just want to talk. I don't think he fell for it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_09"	"Please don't take my stuff."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_10"	"I don't know what the other Ravenhooks have been sayin' about me, but at least 20% of it isn't all true."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_11"	"I don't know what that other meepo is thinking but I hope he's got a plan..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_12"	"I swear to god if that other meepo get's himself killed I am gonna lose it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_13"	"Mazzie. You're alright in my book."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_14"	"I'm tellin' ya, guys like us are misunderstood Mazzie"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_15"	"I just want to be clear, if one of me enlists with the Bronze Legion that doesn't mean we're all signing up, ok?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_16"	"Hey after the battle can I borrow 100 gold? I'm a little low on cash..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_17"	"When this is all over we should talk, I caught wind of a new job. Sure thing. Guaranteed Easy money."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_18"	"I would really appreciate it if you kept me from getting killed Enchantress"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_19"	"I know what you're thinking Lich. Don't do it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_20"	"If it's all the same to you Rooftrellen, I want to stay next to you as long as humanly possible."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_02"	"Thanks."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_03"	"I owe you."

"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_01"	"What can I do to help?"

"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_02"	"You brought this on yourself."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_03"	"You're the one who started this."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_04"	"I just wanted to mind my own business, but now I gotta kill ya..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_05"	"Tough luck, kid..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_01"	"That's the best you got?"

"DCG_VO_luna_intro"	"Once I was like Sorla Khan... a warlord that did as she pleased. Strong and immortal I knew that no man or beast was my equal... until my hubris cost me everything. It was there at my lowest that Selemene found me. Tested me. And showed me the moon lit path. Much time has passed since that day, and I find purpose and pride in protecting the Nightsilver Woods with other members of the Dark Moon. But word has spread of Sorla Khan's march, and while we have never met I understand her all too well. And so I travel to Roseleaf to defeat her, and save her from herself.  "
"DCG_VO_luna_eclipse_intro"	"Selemene has rewarded my faith in her with terrible power, and I have taken a vow never to misuse it. "

"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_armor_05"	"No one will remove me from this battlefield."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"A gift from the goddess."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Selemene provides."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"They will fear me."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Befitting a member of the Dark Moon."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_luna_kill_rival_01"	"Pathetic."
"DCG_VO_luna_kill_rival_02"	"My cause is just, my blade is cruel."

"DCG_VO_luna_unique_03"	"Selemene, your power courses through me!"
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_04"	"It's not ideal, but I do what I must..."
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_05"	"This is just a taste of Selemene's power."
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_06"	"I should have waited."

Once the words used to flow freely from my lips to my scribe Thrael's ears...but lately I have been... distracted by the pulp drivel Goodkind unleashes into the world. I had no idea that the adventures of a monosyllabic red thug could capture so many readers, yet if I am to be honest my own works feel boring in comparison... its vexing. Ah well, I guess it's time to find Goodkind and eat her."

"DCG_VO_sis_o_veil_tower_destroy_05"	"This is an act of mercy."
"DCG_VO_sis_o_veil_tower_saved_01"	"I will hold our position..."

"DCG_VO_sis_o_veil_tower_saved_04"	"You must go through me..."
"DCG_VO_sis_o_veil_tower_saved_05"	"I will defend this place."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_intro"	"Power. Immortality.  Revenge. These are the three biggest reasons people seek mastery of the arcane arts. But they are not my reasons. I pursue magic because it makes anything possible... and if anything is possible then hope, no matter how remote, can never die."

"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_ancient_attack_02"	"I'm afraid this won't end well for you."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_ancient_protect_01"	"We're not finished yet..."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_ancient_protect_02"	"I'm not giving up yet..."

"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_unique_03"	"Here's the grand finale"
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_unique_04"	"I see you met my lovely assistant."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_unique_05"	"The whole act is here."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_unique_06"	"This is getting ridiculous."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_unique_07"	"How do you still have options?"
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_unique_08"	"Selemene I am but a pale shadow of your greatness."

"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_tower_destroy_01"	"The show is almost over..."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_tower_destroy_02"	"For my next trick, I'll make your tower disappear."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_tower_destroy_03"	"Shows over for you..."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_tower_destroy_04"	"Farewell my friend."
"DCG_VO_satyr_magician_tower_destroy_05"	"You put up a noble fight, but I'm afraid it's over."

"DCG_VO_merc_captain_intro"	"I've tried so hard to put my Jasper days behind me...to go back to a normal life. Take a husband, have a kid. It sounded pretty great. And that's when I learned that kids are really expensive.  So I may not delight in violence, but I do excell at it... and my expertise can be yours for a very reasonable fee."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_summon_01"	"Alright, who am I killing?"
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_summon_02"	"Time to get to work."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_summon_03"	"You get what you pay for."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_ancient_attack_01"	"You're not paying me by the hour, let's get this over with."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_ancient_attack_02"	"This shouldn't take long..."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_ancient_protect_01"	"They won't get through me!"
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_ancient_protect_02"	"Leave this to me..."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_ancient_both_01"	"Well this'll be exciting..."

"DCG_VO_merc_captain_hero_friend_02"	"Nice to be on the same side for once, Sorla..."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_hero_friend_03"	"I work with you Tresdin, but I don’t take orders from you."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_hero_rival_01"	"This isn't the first time I've had to take on the Red Mist."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_hero_rival_02"	"Nothing personal Rix."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_hero_rival_03"	"You think the Bronze Legion are the only ones who know how to fight?"
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_01"	"OK, maybe I spoke too soon."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_02"	"Cute staff. You're dead."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_03"	"Time to find out if the legend lives up to the hype."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_04"	"Your bosses should've hired me..."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_05"	"I shouldn't have taken this job."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_06"	"We keep bumping into each other meepo..."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_07"	"Just business."

"DCG_VO_merc_captain_tower_destroy_05"	"You got it...."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_tower_saved_01"	"Ill protect the tower!"

"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_intro"	"For generations the Rumusque Faithful have defended the living world from the abominations that slink from the Fields of Endless Carnage. We were known as men and women of principle. Of valor. Of Devotion. And then Necrophos tried to destroy us all."

"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_friend_02"	"Your kindness is an example to all, enchantress. Well, not me, but most. "
"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_friend_03"	"Is this the beginning of your redemption Necrophos?"
"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_rival_01"	"You're a traitor to the faith!"
"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_rival_02"	"You'll pay for what you've done Necrophos."
"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_rival_03"	"The unclean will be purged."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_intro"	"So there I was: drinking with my friends, well actually I was drinking alone but I was thinking about my friends so it's basically the same thing. Anyway. Sniper walks into my workshop and is like 'Mazzie, you're wasting your life' and I'm like 'Geeze Sniper, if I wanted to feel bad about myself I'd ask my parents why they never visit me on my birthday' but Sniper's not interested in hearing about parental abandonment, he's interested in uniting the Keenfolk clans. So I say I'll help: on the condition that I get to give our group a cool name. Sniper rolled his eyes and sighed, which is basically the same thing as a yes, and THAT'S how the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk was born."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_defensive_stance"	"Sometimes people ask me 'Mazzie, how do you keep from getting killed if everyone hates you?' and that's when I tell them 'The secret is not letting them stab you to death.' "
"DCG_VO_mazzie_steel_reinforcemnet"	"When you have a whole town looking to destroy your workshop, you get pretty good at reinforcing buildings."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Just what this baby needed."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Oh man, this is great!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I needed this!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I can't wait to kill someone with this thing!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Wait till Sniper sees me use this badboy..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_01"	"No one's hurting me in this baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_02"	"No one's killin' me now. Unless they poison me, that would kill me pretty quick."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_03"	"This is the toughest thing on the battlefield."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Bristleback's got nothin' on me..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Just try to hurt me! Unless you're in the Jasper Circle, in which case: don't try to hurt me."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"I love this!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Beautiful!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"This is gonna be great!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"I can't wait to use this!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"I always wanted one of these!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_01"	"Sorry!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_02"	"It's not personal!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_03"	"Listen; technically, you dying is kind of your fault."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_04"	"Don't take it personal, I'm just better than you."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_05"	"Guys, cant we just talk about this? I really want to stop killing your friends."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_06"	"You see what I'm driven' right? Why aren't you running?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_07"	"Whoohoo!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_08"	"Yeahhhhhh buddy!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_09"	"You obviously never fought a giant robot before."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_10"	"Don't mess with the SOLK, baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_use_include_01"	"This place needs a little Keenfolk love."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_use_include_02"	"Let me set up some defenses for ya...."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_use_include_03"	"You need the place fortified? I'm on it."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_01"	"Hey Sniper, you ready to have some fun?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_02"	"Listen sniper, I've been thinkin: Tinker really needs to give me a laser."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_03"	"Sniper, I've been thinking - we need to do more team building with Timbersaw and Tinker."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_04"	"Alright Timby, here's the deal: stop worrying about trees, it's not healthy."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_05"	"Hey. Timbersaw. Have you ever tried not being crazy?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_06"	"Ok Timbersaw here's the deal: people don't like us, so we're gonna have to work extra hard to change their minds."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_07"	"Tinker, I know we had a rocky start I know you're gonna love me."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_08"	"Ya know, if you won't give me a laser, the least you could do is outfit one of the golems."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_09"	"We're going to hang out all the time Tinker. All. The. Time."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_10"	"I love hanging out with you guys!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_11"	"I don't think Tinker likes me very much, Sniper... can you make him be my friend? "
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_12"	"I know some people think you guys use guns because you're cowards that like to fight a mile away; but not me. I know it's because you guys don't know how to build a decent robot."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_13"	"You guys didn’t come to wine tasting night yesterday, what gives?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_14"	"Listen guys, I don't want to make you jealous, but Sniper likes me more than you."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_15"	"Look I'm not saying Sniper said that I'm smarter than you. I'm saying that in his heart he knows its true."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_16"	"It's the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_17"	"Guys - I was thinking - after the battle we should get matching tattoos. "
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_18"	"If Tinker thinks he can replace me with a golem he's got another thing comin'..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_19"	"Just remember who made who, buddy."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_20"	"I uh... I probably shouldn't have made that golem so resource intensive."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_02"	"Time for some repairs."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_03"	"much better..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_04"	"Good as new..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_05"	"Nothing I can't hammer out..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_01"	"Guysguysguysguysguys...I have a robot!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_02"	"Here comes Mazzie baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_03"	"Who's ready to fight!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_04"	"Here I come!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_05"	"Time to take that tower out!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_06"	"We got this!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_07"	"It's our time to shine baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_08"	"Let's show 'em what we can do!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_09"	"We can win this thing!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_10"	"Leave this to me!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_01"	"I got ya now..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_02"	"Big mistake, buddy..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_03"	"Sorry pal!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_04"	"You can't stop me!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_05"	"Just die already!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_01"	"Whew!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_02"	"That was a close call..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_03"	"Cute trick, but I'm ready for anything."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_04"	"People have been trying to kill me since I was 6 months old."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_05"	"If Tinker couldn't kill me, what chance do you have?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_01"	"This thing is getting ridiculous!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_02"	"Let's seem get through this now...."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_03"	"Time to reinforce this thing."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_04"	"Let's get some new armor on this thing."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_05"	"No one's getting through this thing..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_01"	"Sniper thinks I’m not lethal enough? I'll show him lethal..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_02"	"Time to make some modifications..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_03"	"I can supe this badboy up..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_04"	"Now we're talkin..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_05"	"This is what I like to see"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_01"	"Time to toughen up."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_02"	"I gotta be ready for anything..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_03"	"Some times armor isn't enough..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_04"	"All right!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_05"	"I'm not going anywhere!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_01"	"I got a bunch of cool stuff I wanna show you!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_02"	"Didn't expect this did you?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_03"	"CHARGE!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_04"	"What's this button do?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_05"	"I gotta try this out!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_06"	"You know my suit can do this?"

"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_03"	"Tinker's never gonna let me hear the end of this..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_04"	"I really hope I don't die."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_05"	"We probably should have planned better."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_06"	"Not gonna lie, when I woke up this morning I didn't think I was going to die."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_07"	"How is this even happening.."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_08"	"This doesn't make any sense..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_09"	"Oh boy..."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_08"	"You just woke the Thunderhide baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_09"	"You ever see a Keenfolk rage? It is not pretty."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_10"	"You're making some poor life choices my friend!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_01"	"It's not your fault you're losing, I'm just better."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_02"	"Come on, who's gonna stop us?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_03"	"If I was worried about you guys I wouldn't have polished off the wine from Icewrack last night."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_04"	"Time to get real: no one is better than me."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_05"	"You're jealous of the robot. It happens."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_06"	"Do you know how many people have tried to kill me in this thing?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_07"	"Ancient'. It's a rock what's the big deal."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_08"	"Magic is so much lamer than science."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_09"	"Who needs a magic spell when I can just punch you in the face? And by 'me' I mean my robot."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_10"	"I'm not trying to brag. But Snipers my best friend and he totally hates you."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_04"	"Hey Tinker, your robots suck!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_05"	"I wonder what's gonna happen next..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_06"	"here goes nothing..."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_08"	"It's on now!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_09"	"I've been wanting to try this out forever"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_10"	"Let's see what this thing can REALLY do..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_defensive_stance"	"Sometimes people ask me 'Mazzie, how do you keep from getting killed if everyone hates you?' and that's when I tell them 'The secret is not letting them stab you to death.' "

On one hand it's a shame... a warrior like Tresdin deserves more than dying in some backwater vhoul city.  On the other, perhaps it is a mercy that she will be spared from seeing her beloved city burn. "
