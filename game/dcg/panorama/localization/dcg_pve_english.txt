	//01 - TARES
	"DCG_a01m01_title"				"Transgressions of Tares"
	"DCG_a01m01_desc"				"After centuries of uneasy deference to the might of Stonehall, the nobles of Tares secretly negotiate to procure soldiers and sellswords — whispering promises of golden plunder and a life free of Emperor Galanius' legions."
	"DCG_a01m01_outro_desc"				"With the long siege finally at an end, the Bronze Legion assemble the surviving nobles of Tares to begin the difficult process of unification — introducing them to life under the banner of Stonehall."
	
	"DCG_a1m01_Intro_LC_pl_01"	"Tares started like any other war — on the emperor's whim. After centuries of irrelevance, the Taresian nobles got to mind that all it would take to edge in on Stonehall would be a bigger army. So they started collecting an impressive number of two-penny troops. So many that they're about to learn the difference between a mob of sorry mercs and the Bronze Legion. The best Stonehall has to offer. And the emperor doesn't send us to negotiate."
	
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_RX_pl_01" 	"With the siege at an end, we were tasked with gathering the surviving nobles of Tares. To introduce them to life under the banner of Stonehall. We found the body of that proverbial snake quick enough, but not the head. Seems our war out here is not yet done."
	
	
	
	//02 - FILEDO
	"DCG_a01m02_title"				"Fled to Filedo"
	"DCG_a01m02_desc"				"Following her victory at Tares, Commander Tresdin and the Bronze Legion march on Filedo — the last refuge of the Taresian nobles who incurred the wrath of Stonehall."
	"DCG_a01m02_outro_desc"				"Making quick work of the forces at Filedo, Commander Tresdin turns her attention to the looming threat from Crester — stirred to action by the fall of Tares and Stonehall's further encroachment."
	
	"DCG_a01m02_Intro_Marc_pl_01"	"Nobles are all the same. Leave the needy people to die while they slip out 'round the back. You won't find me surprised that these Taresian snakes had a bolthole ready. You also won't find me complaining that we get to ruin their fun all the same."
	
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Tres_pl_01"	"While we mopped up the filth at Filedo, Rix went on to Crester — the sleeping giant of this grand excursion. Crester never took much interest in Stonehall's expansion into far off lands, but with the bulwark of Tares and Filedo no longer between us, the situation got a bit more complicated... We'll hope for good news from Rix."



	//03 - CRESTER
	"DCG_a01m03_title"				"The Crester Conspiracy"
	"DCG_a01m03_desc"				"TEMP TEXT TEMP TEXT Did you notice Rix missing from the last battle? He was here, in Crester, engineering a surrender from within. This will be playable at some point. TEMP TEXT TEMP TEXT"
	
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Rix_pl_01"	"TEMP TEXT TEMP TEXT Congrats! You defeated Crester without a single drop of (Bronze Legion) blood. TEMP TEXT TEMP TEXT"



	//04 - TARES AGAIN
	"DCG_a01m04_title"				"The Trouble with Tares"
	"DCG_a01m04_desc"				"Responding to a resurgent resistance in Tares — organized by the very Taresian nobles whose lives she spared — Commander Tresdin leads a small patrol to negotiate a second surrender — or secure one by force."

	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_LC_pl_01"		"In some cities, the aristocracy can be leveraged to keep the people in line. Maybe stop a bunch of needless death. In others...like Tares, they just can't bring themselves to let go of that top rung of power. The second or third rung will never be good enough. Usually I can tell one city from the other in a drum beat. Maybe I'm losing my touch..."
	
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Rix_pl_01"	"We might take the old forest road to catch the legion. Even with this many troops, could cut days off our journey. Though I won't vouch for its safety..."


	//05 - SCOUT PARTY
	"DCG_a01m05_title"				"Quickly by the Old Road"
	"DCG_a01m05_desc"				"After quelling the Taresian uprising, Commander Tresdin hurries by uncertain shortcut to rejoin her army on its march to Kailens. But her small force isn't the only trouble lurking on the abandoned forest road..."

	"DCG_a01m05_Intro_Rix_pl_01"	"Commander, our scout was spotted by a squad of Red Mist troops. If they have friends nearby, our patrol would have no chance against them. We need to wipe this bunch out before they get far."
	
	"DCG_a01m05_Outro_LC_pl_01"		"Red Mist here... Doesn't bode well. We should have taken one alive. For now, we continue on to Kailens. Rejoin the legion."

	//06 - KAILENS
	"DCG_a01m06_title"				"Kailens"
	"DCG_a01m06_desc"				"With the Red Mist scouts forever silenced, Tresdin rejoins the Bronze Legion in Kailens — where the fleeing holdouts from Crester have created instability for normal life in the surrounding lands."
	
	"DCG_a01m06_Intro_Rix_pl_01"	"The lords and soldiers fleeing Crester's fall have done no favors for the small folk of the region. Establishing a command in Kailens would go a long way to restoring some order to these lands. Though it might be too much to hope Kailens will see it that way as well."

	"DCG_a01m06_Outro_Marcus_pl_01"	"Hardly a real fight, but I guess it does some good. This'll all be Stonehall in the end. Only way it goes now."

	//07 - SLOQOIT

	"DCG_a01m07_title"				"Sloqoit"
	"DCG_a01m07_desc"				"Without the trade and commerce of Crester and Kailens to support them, the people of Sloqoit have small hope for a future without Stonehall. Though some in power may resist, even the masses can read the writing on the wall."
	
	"DCG_a01m07_Intro_Marcus_pl_01"		"With Crester and Kailens heeled, this place has no hope without Stonehall. Better they accept that sooner n' later."
	
	"DCG_a01m07_Outro_Rix_pl_01"	"The people of Sloqoit will see the wisdom of our actions. But perhaps not today..."


	//08 - SASHIRE
	"DCG_a01m08_title"				"Sashire"
	"DCG_a01m08_desc"				"Though reclusive, the rustic nation of Sashire is now surrounded by Stonehall territory, transformed into a circle on the map that Emperor Galanius will not want to see."
	
	"DCG_a01m08_Intro_Rix_pl_01"	"They give more resistance than I expected, commander. But I don't expect we'll take long. Marcus has things well in hand."
	
	"DCG_a01m08_Outro_LC_pl_01"		"We have word from Stonehall. The Red Mist marches against the empire. Tarrin is the target... but Sorla Khan is smarter than this. There must be more at play..."

	
	//09 - TARRIN
	
	"DCG_a01m09_title"				"Tarrin"

	"DCG_a01m09_desc"				"TEMP TEXT TEMP TEXT After surveying the Red Mist's meager siege on Tarrin, Legion Commander orders her forces to march on Roseleaf, Sorla Khan's true target. Rix and Marcus are sent in advance to conscript Roseleaf's Vhouls into the Bronze Legion. TEMP TEXT TEMP TEXT"
	//"DCG_a01m09_desc"				"After learning of the Red Mist invasion, Commander Tresdin dispatches Rix and Marcus to lead the Bronze Legion to Roseleaf, where she suspects Sorla Khan's true target lies. She resolves to reconnoiter besieged Tarrin herself so she can see the Red Mist strategy before returning to Stonehall to warn the emperor."
	
	//"DCG_a01m09_Intro_LC_pl_01"		"If the emperor will not side with me, the Bronze Legion will go it alone. The fate of the Empire lies in Roseleaf... I know it. But I have to see Tarrin first, or Galanius will never be sure... I'll get nothing from him without a fight."


	//10 - ROSELEAF
	"DCG_a01m10_title"				"Roseleaf"
	"DCG_a01m10_desc"				"Defying Emperor Galanius' orders, Tresdin rides to rejoin her legion in Roseleaf and face Sorla Khan. Little does she know, a painful betrayal awaits."

	
	//mission 01 intro
	
	
	
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_01"	"Trouble in Tares, Commander Tresdin."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_02"	"Tares has been pissing off Stonehall royalty since before there WAS a Bronze Legion. What's new?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_03"	"Belasanno's spies suggest this is something new. Something...worthy of concern. And your attention."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Marcus_04"	"I could DO with a bit of concern. Another night at Leadbelly's and I won't be able to squeeze into my armor."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_05"	"Our orders are to muster and clear Stonehall's border by half moon."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_06"	"That soon?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_07"	"Tares is amassing an army."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Marcus_08"	"Ha. A bunch of sorry militia n' mercenaries, maybe — no true soldiering force."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_09"	"How many troops did the emperor give us?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_10"	"Ten cohorts."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_11"	"I won't complain about ten."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_12"	"Emperor Galanius wishes to send a message."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Marcus_13"	"Quite a message. We'll be back in Stonehall before the foam on my ale flattens."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_14"	"Tares may not boast legendary fighters, but her walls are not weak."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_15"	"Nor the minds of those behind them. If they risk angering Stonehall, they'll be prepared. Sound muster — we need to be as well."
	
	//mission 01 in-game
	"DCG_a01m01_InGame_Tres_01"		"All right, I want two of these towers taken down."
	"DCG_a01m01_InGame_Marcus_02"	"YOU HEARD THE COMMANDER!"
	"DCG_a01m01_InGame_Rix_03"		"..."
	
	//mission 01 outro
	
	
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tres_01"	"Who's left to speak for Tares?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tares_02" "If it pleases my lady. I beg of you, spare this assembly. Many here argued against aggression towards Stonehall. They should not lose their lives for our Lord Regent's mistakes."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tres_03" "The battle is won. We don't slaughter helpless prisoners."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Rix_04" "We put them to work."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Marc_05" "And expect them to talk. Which they all do. Eventually."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tares_06" "Of course! I know a great deal —"
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Rix_07" "Starting with where we can find Lord Regent Lannock."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tares_08" "Our beloved Lannock...did not survive the siege. He was unwell even before it began. His nephew Hosta became Lord Regent. Hosta had...new ideas for the future of Tares."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tres_09" "Is he among the slain?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tares_10" "No. He has abandoned us. Fled with his loyalists to Filedo. With the Filedo ore mines in hand, his forces have resource enough they cannot be ignored. Not even by a force of your size."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tres_11" "Marcus?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Marc_12" "Well...we could leave a cohort or two here and move the bulk against Filedo. The mines would be a nice prize."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Rix_13" "Should we seek Stonehall's council first?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tres_14" "I already know what the Emperor will say. Instead we'll give the troops a short rest. Then we march."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Marc_15" "Understood. And if our new friend's information is...unreliable?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tres_16" "Then he'll be the first example made when we come back."
	"DCG_a01m01_Outro_Tares_17" "That will not be necessary. No one wishes to see the Lord Regent's head on a pike more than I."
	
	
	//mission 02 intro
	
	
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Marc_01" "Save yourself the months of suffering! Open the gates, Lord Hosta!"
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Filedo_02" "You — who slaughter our kin and threaten our beloved Lord — know this! The brave folk of Filedo will fight to the last breath — to honor the fallen of Tares!"
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_03" "Your 'beloved lord' has pushed these people to the breaking point. Now you push them past it. I wonder... How FEW will we have to kill before 'your people' realize Stonehall's peace is the better path?"
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Filedo_04" "We'll never kneel to Stonehall! I'd debase myself before the Council of Crester first."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Marc_05" "That can be arranged! ... Well, looks like they want it the hard way."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_06" "About Crester, Commander... It could become a problem. There's a reason previous Emperors knew not to march on Tares. And it had nothing to do with the might of her army."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_07" "Previous Emperors knew...but here we are. If Crester's going to be a problem, we'll need to get ahead of it "
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Marc_08" "Tares with ten cohorts was one thing. Crester, quite another."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_09" "Come on, Marcus. I thought you were sick of the soft life. Rix, start sniffing around Crester. See what you can dig up."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_09a"	"I'll leave at once."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Marc_10" "Yeah, Rix. Do what you do best — slink away."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_11" "..."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Tres_12" "That's enough, Marcus. You know your value to me, Rix. To the Empire."
	"DCG_a01m01_Intro_Rix_13" "Always, commander."
	
	
	//mission 02 outro
	
	
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Filedo_01"	"Great fools of Stonehall! You waste your time and blood in Filedo while our brothers work against you in Tares. Soon, your victories will ring as hollow as the mind of your pathetic emperor!"
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Tres_02"	"Pack him off to Stonehall. The Emperor and his gaolers will appreciate the distraction."
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Marc_03"	"Think he was telling the truth about Tares?"
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Tres_04"	"Crester's a bigger threat than Tares ever was. All the same... Send a messenger to the troops we left behind."
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Marc_05"	"Where's Rix when you need him..."
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Tres_06"	"His missions to Crester have planted valuable seeds."
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Marc_07"	"I'm waiting to see what he can accomplish that an entire legion can't."
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Tres_08"	"Underestimate Rix if you will, Marcus. He'd make a cunning adversary."
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Marc_09"	"You...overvalue his contributions. Someone needs to show that pup his place."
	"DCG_a01m02_Outro_Tres_10"	"His place is at our side. Don't forget."
	
	
	//mission 03 intro
	
	
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Tres_01" "It's good to see you, Rix. What's the latest from Crester?"
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Rix_02" "I pulled some strings. Clipped a few others. No way of knowing how well it all worked until we move in."
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Tres_03" "The information alone was worth your time. Even if we have to do it the hard way."
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Marc_04" "Gods. I could almost see their bloody walls all the way in Filedo."
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Rix_05" "Nervous, Marcus?"
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Marc_06" "Try me, cur."
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Tres_07" "Pay attention to the fight that actually MEANS something."
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Marc_08" "..."
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Rix_09" "Of course, commander."
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Tres_10" "You said it yourself, Marcus. Look at those walls. You don't have to be an archivist to know the blood of NATIONS has soaked the ground at their base. If things go hard, the three of us--certainly YOU--could die of OLD AGE before Stonehall takes this city."
	"DCG_a01m03_Intro_Marc_11" "Well, Rix... Tell us what we're marching into."
	
	//mission 04 intro
	
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Rix_01" "We've cornered them, Commander. But their demands are...madness. I don't think we can negotiate with this type."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Marc_02" "Heh. The old-fashioned way suits me just fine. What are we waiting for?"
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Tares_03" "Pull your forces back or the truce bearer gets it!"
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Legio_04" "Kill me and a thousand more will come."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Tres_05" "Listen to reason. Life isn't going to change so much under Stonehall's rule. A little better some ways. A little worse in others. But it'll be a LIFE. Your path here leads only to death."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Tares_06" "You're right, commander... And we might as well start with this one. Give him the spear, boys!"
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Legio_07" "My life!...for Stonehall..."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Tares_08" "We are the old blood of Tares! And we will die before we bow to pack of slaves like you."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Tres_09" "Marcus."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Marc_10" "Yes, Commander."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Tres_11" "Show him how happy we are to oblige."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Rix_12" "Yes, Marcus. Do what YOU do best."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Marc_13" "You see, Rix...unlike you, I take that as a compliment."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Tares_14" "Tonight we take back our city from the mongrel legion of Stonehall!"
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Tres_15" "Any time, Marcus."
	"DCG_a01m04_Intro_Marc_16" "Swords up then, boys and girls! Old Tares dies tonight."
	
	//mission 04 in-game
	"DCG_a01m04_InGame_Rix_01"		"A trap... they've been amassing resources and mana..."
	"DCG_a01m04_InGame_Marcus_02"	"Then we'll just have to starve them out, won't we?"
	"DCG_a01m04_InGame_Tres_03"		"Siege it is."
	
	//mission 04 outro
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Rix_01" "It seems Tares is settled."
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Tres_02"  "Again. Let's hope we don't have to come back here."
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Marc_03"  "I don't know. I could kind of get used to kicking this place's teeth in."
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Tres_04"  "It's time to get back to my legion. Not everyone in Crester was so eager to surrender. A few left the city before we arrived. Now they're making trouble. For our forces and the folk in the countryside."
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Rix_05"  "Securing Kailens and her surrounding lands would go a long way to calming the region."
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Marc_06"  "Heh. 'Calming the region.' Sign me right up."
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Tres_07"  "Send a raven ahead. Tell the main force to meet us on the road to Kailens. We'll skip Filedo and Crester, find them on the way."
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Marc_08"  "You know a shortcut?"
	"DCG_a01m04_Outro_Rix_09"  "The old trade road. It skirts the mountains. Sparsely traveled. We should make good time."
	
	//mission 05 in-game
	"DCG_a01m05_InGame_Rix_01"		"These Red Mist Scouts can't be permitted to report our position!"
	"DCG_a01m05_InGame_Tres_02"		"Kill those Scouts before they escape!"
	
	//mission 10 in-game
	"DCG_a01m10_InGame_Tres_01"		"By the crown... what have you done, Rix? Where's Marcus?"
	"DCG_a01m10_InGame_Rix_02"		"It's too late for Marcus. But you can still make this right, Tresdin."
	"DCG_a01m10_InGame_Rix_03"		"Withdraw from Roseleaf, Commander. And you, Sorla Kahn."
	"DCG_a01m10_InGame_Tres_04"		"Rix--"
	"DCG_a01m10_InGame_Sorla_05"	"STRIKE NOW"

	"DCG_a03m01_desc"				"For generations the battle-priests of Rumusque have defended these lands from the influence of the Dead God. However, the last decade has seen the slow spread of the Dead God's plague. The Cathedral of Rumusque has been a haven for the afflicted, but is now threatened directly by the Dead God's army."

	"DCG_a3m01_Intro_AN_pl_01"	"After 10 years of nonstop suffering, the Plague has finally reached our doorstep - hand-delivered by the Herald of the Dead God, Dirge the Undying. We now prepare to defend the Cathedral of Rumusque, possibly for the last time."
