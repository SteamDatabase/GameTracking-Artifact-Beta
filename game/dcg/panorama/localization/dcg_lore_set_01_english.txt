	"CardLore_10263"		"Long ago, the Apotheosis Blade was forged with a singular and wicked purpose: to let the wielder kill a god and assume its power. Today, it is but one of many accursed artifacts safely tucked away inside the Burnt Hall of Weeping Rose. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10202"		"To bolster their numbers, the Sisters of the Veil often abduct children and train them in their ways. When they come of age, they are bestowed this in preparation of their first kill. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"

	"CardLore_10212"		"The Knights of the Vigil were renowned for their skill in battle. The stories of Sven, Geeta the Wildblade, and Klemens have captured the imagination of so many... you can't throw a rock in the Gardens of Freth without hitting a group of school kids recreating their adventures. But playing a knight is easy... wielding one of their swords is far more challenging. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10206"		"For years Axe has yearned to trade out his blink dagger for a blink axe, and for years Goodkind has had to remind him that blink axes don't exist. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10235"		"Vanessa wanted to take it to the Burnt Hall. Pierpont wanted it safely locked away with the Sapphire Conclave. It was the Crystal Maiden who suggested that they leave it with Auroth... reluctantly, they agreed. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"

	"CardLore_10214"		"Leather armor is cheaper, but you get what you pay for. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10241"		"It was Pierpont who helped broker the Claszureme Treaty, ensuring that Faceless Void would not wreak havoc with our time stream. In exchange, the Sapphire Conclave agreed to enforce a strict crackdown on Chronomancy. Most hourglasses on this plane were confiscated, but every now and again one turns up... usually in the possession of a wizard too foolish to understand the consequences of his actions — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10238"		"You can kill a whole lotta people with this thing.  — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10231"		"Nestled in the Fields of Endless Carnage lies the city of Quoidge. An undead metropolis where slovenly butchers rub shoulders with the most proper of corpses. To the living, this cloak is grotesque. To dead, it's the height of fashion. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10210"		"Magic can be more fragile than most people think. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10213"		"Icewrack is not a clever name. It's cold there. Very cold. And those that don't dress for the weather won't be around long enough to enjoy the view. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10216"		"In Revtel everyone is looking for a bargain...  — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"

	"CardLore_10260"		"Every year, a group of centaurs from the Marrowfell Tribe are chosen to go on 'The Great Hunt'. The goal of this expedition is to test the skill and endurance of the tribe's finest trackers. To these men and women, there is no glory greater than claiming the horn of a Thunderhide Alpha for their own. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10256"		"Many characterise the Jasper Circle as a group of assassins for hire... this is a crude oversimplification. Lorlin Lasan's spy ring offers many services to those who can afford them, murder just happens to be the most popular. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10218"		"The Keenfolk are a clever people always looking for a way to use science to improve things... even warfare. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"

	"CardLore_10211"		"In the right hands, this orb can undermine the most well laid of plans... naturally Vanessa always keeps a few in her possession. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10222"		"In Xhacatocatl, High Priests don these bracers when preparing to make an offering to the Flayed Twins. So devout are the priests in their faith, that if a suitable sacrifice can not be found to please The Twins, they are willing to offer themselves instead. Well, \"willing\" is relative, some try to make a run for it and are tied down screaming, but generally they're all on board. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10203"		"To many this pair of boots seems like a lesser magical item... but in the right hands these can turn the tide of any battle. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10237"		"It's not magical, but it is effective. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10234"		"A Marrowfell Hunter's skinning knife is one of their most prized possession. Made during a centaur coming-of-age ritual, each knife is unique to its wielder, and each one tells a specific story. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10259"		"The...'unique' personality of many Keenfolk lead to the development of armor that could respond to the number of people trying to beat them up. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10223"		"Long ago, the Oglodi capital was a shining beacon of art and philosophy... and then they met the Tarnsmen. A barbarous group of demon worshipers, the Tarns lay siege to the Oglodi's great city, sating their bloodlust on any they could find. It was a massacre. The battle ended, only because the Tarns grew bored... and left a great civilization in ashes. Ever a resilient people, the Oglodi rebuilt and started again... referring to the razing of their capital as 'The Bleak Day'. But for some rebuilding was not enough. They believed that forsaking the martial in favor of the esoteric is what led to their down fall... and so they left and formed the first Red Mist Horde. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10207"		"Three nations collectively make up The Merchant Kingdom of Revtel.  And while each of the Merchant Kings is recognized as sovereign within their own lands, in the Revtel capital, each are equal. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10220"		"Some say this ring can let it's bearer live forever. Naturally that's an exaggeration, a Tarrasque itself isn't an immortal creature, though it does make you wonder... if this ring is fashioned out of bone and muscle, what could someone do with a Tarrasque's heart? — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10230"		"To those willing to step into a world of Demonic etiquette and politics, the Court of Ristul is willing to offer considerable power... for a price. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10217"		"The warrior priests of the Rumusque Faithful are led by Lady Anshu, and their mere presence can bolster the hearts of the virtuous — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"

	"CardLore_10243"		"Aquila is long since dead, but there are those who still seek out items of the famed warlord. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10242"		"The rivalry between Aquila and Basilius is often dramatized by bards throughout the world... but with so many renditions covering all manner of points of view, it's become almost impossible to tell what is fact and what is fiction. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10248"		"If the Seraphim Shield is a hammer, Shiva’s Guard is a scalpel — and when wielded properly can hobble the mightiest of armies. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10255"		"Welcome to the wonderful world of commerce. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10205"		"The bullsnake is a fitting symbol for Stonehall. They conquer. They occupy. They move on. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10252"		"The Bronze Legion's hallmark is discipline... not a day goes by where its soldiers aren't training to be the best. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10253"		"The forges of Stonehall blacksmiths burn day and night, fueling Emperor Galanius' war machine. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10225"		"To say Galanius is a polarizing figure is an understatement. The Emperor of Stonehall is seen by many of his people as a savior who brought them safety... to others he is a merciless conqueror that has destroyed their people's way of life. But no matter their position, everyone knows better than to publically question his authority. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"
	"CardLore_10226"		"The All Seeing One anointed this hammer, giving its wielder the strength to bolster their allies and crush their enemies. — <i>Jolixia, The Card Faun</i>"



	//Heroes and includes
	"CardLore_10030" 	"I never went to some fancy military school to learn how to beat a man half to death... that's what bars were for. — <i>Bristleback, Barfly</i>"
	"CardLore_10419" 	"It's not gonna score points with the ladies, but when it comes to winning a fight I'll take every advantage I can get. — <i>Bristleback, Dirty Fighter</i>"
	"CardLore_10536" 	"There are number of things one could say about Zeus.  He has a delightful mustache. His physique is chiseled out of marble.  And when it comes to two-timing your wife while disguised as a swan, there is no equal.  But one thing he is not is 'The God of Thunder'.  For I am thunder.  And lightning.  And wind.  And rain.  Indeed, I am the tempest itself... and there is no god to whom I bow. — <i>Storm Spirit, Zeus' Rival</i>"
	"CardLore_10538" 	"The so-called 'God of Thunder' may use his feet to get around, but the true Lord of Lightning has a better means of travel. — <i>Storm Spirit, Swift As Lightning</i>"
	"CardLore_10070" 	"This isn't my fight.  But if I don't stand with the Vhoul it's only a matter of time before the Bronze Legion comes for my people.  A message needs to be sent... and it will be bloody. — <i>Ursa, Tribal Protector</i>"
	"CardLore_10282" 	"When you see one of my people fight, it is not just a body on a battlefield.  Each of us is joined by the spirits of our ancestors, and it's their strength that fuels us... — <i>Ursa, Guided By His Ancestors</i>"
	"CardLore_10069" 	"I know these people think me a monster.  I don't blame them.  No one wants to be occupied, but it's in their best interests! If we weren't here in Roseleaf the Red Mist would have slaughtered them all... today the Vhoul see us as villains, but after we defeat Sorla Khan... The Bronze Legion will be heralded as the heroes we are. — <i>Tresdin, Legion Commander</i>"
	"CardLore_10341" 	"How many more of our people need to die?  Let's just end this here and now. — <i>Legion Commander, The battle of Roseleaf</i>"
	"CardLore_10068" 	"The Red Mist slowly marches to Stonehall.  The Bronze Legion plans an ambush in Roseleaf.  But the denizens of that Vhoul city do not take kindly to occupation and have sparked an insurrection.  Three factions.  One battlefield.  And not a strategic mind between them.  I will defeat these charlatans of war.  And in doing so, prove my brilliance. — <i>Ish'kafel, the Dark Seer</i>"
	"CardLore_10281" 	"A thug knows only how to swing a sword... he gives no thought into the consequences... this predictable behavior is easily exploited. — <i>Dark Seer, Master Tactician</i>"
	"CardLore_10053" 	"Brothers and sisters, The Ancient is coming.  With every passing day my visions grow stronger:  A violet sky.  A sundered moon.  And an Ancient voice that whispers 'Prepare for my arrival.'  Prepare.  Such a simple word that does no justice to the work that lies before us... We must be heralds; walking testimonies to the benevolence of The Ancient.  Spreading the word of its glorious arrival, no matter if that message is received with joy or scorn.  We must be architects; building not just this monastery for those who believe what I have seen, but an entire world that is worthy of the Ancient's splendor.  We must be zealots; willing to lay down our lives in defense of this sacred space, because rest assured we are at war.  Kanna and her heretics will stop at nothing to undo the work that we've accomplished, and that is why we must return in kind. — <i>Prellex, Priestess of the Radiant</i>"
	"CardLore_10055" 	"More of the faithful come by the day... and they will need a home to house them. — <i>Prellex, Bringer of the Faithful</i>"
	"CardLore_10067" 	"I'm no stranger to man's lust for conquest.  To be seen not as a person but as a commodity... and I refuse to stand idly by while the Vhoul are subjugated.  It's too late for my people... but it might not be too late for theirs. — <i>Magnus, Endangered Protector</i>"
	"CardLore_10280" 	"The strength of my people lives in me... and I will use it to find those who hunt my kin. — <i>Magnus, Proud Magnoceros</i>"
	"CardLore_10065" 	"I care little for the affairs of mortals.  I have no stake in the war between the Red Mist and the Bronze Legion, and the plight of the Vhoul does little to stir my blood.  What I DO care about however, is that charlatan Storm Spirit claiming my lightning as his own... and so I travel to Roseleaf; to prove that there is no god of lightning above me. — <i>Zeus, Lord of Heaven</i>"
	"CardLore_10278" 	"The full brunt of my fury is something beautiful and terrible to behold. — <i>Zeus, Angry God</i>"
	"CardLore_10064" 	"'Warden of Icewrack.'  It's a fancy title.  In theory it means I'm responsible for maintaining law and order, collaborating with the Sapphire Conclave on magical crimes, and protecting the weak from all manners of nasty things.  In practice I help farmers fix fences.  So I decided to go on a little sabbatical.  Besides... I couldn't stay in Icewrack.  It's cold.  It's boring.  And I heard my sister was planning on visiting so I definitely had to get the hell outta there. — <i>Rylai, the Crystal Maiden</i>"
	"CardLore_10277" 	"Unlike Lina, I like to try to find solutions that don't involve killing everyone. — <i>Crystal Maiden, Less Destructive Sister</i>"
	"CardLore_10062" 	"I empathize with Rix.  It's not easy following the orders of a leader you despise.  But I don't have the luxury of staging a rebellion...the stakes are too high, and so I must bide my time... and wait to be reunited with my beloved. — <i>Dragonus, the Skywrath Mage</i>"
	"CardLore_10063" 	"I dedicated my life to the pursuit of the mystic arts...But while my head was buried in books, my beloved was betrayed and cast out of the Ghastly Eyrie.  I was unable to save her then... but at least I have the power to save her now. — <i>Skywrath Mage, Guilt-Wrecked</i>"
	"CardLore_10060" 	"I am a hunted man. The Court of Ristul seek my hand.    The Anti-Mage, my head.  Now I seek asylum in Weeping Rose, but first I must seek the Quorum's emissary. — <i>Lion, the Demon Witch</i>"
	"CardLore_10275" 	"The demon's hand grants me not just the ability to snuff out life.  But to consume their very essence. — <i>Lion, Mage Bane</i>"
	"CardLore_10059" 	"For years I travelled, spreading the gift of pestilence city by city.  But now a unique opportunity has arisen.  If I can infect the Red Mist Horde... they can do the travelling for me, and pass along my gift faster than I could ever dream. — <i>Rotund'jere, the Necrophos</i>"
	"CardLore_10274" 	"The weak are not worthy to be culled by my blade. — <i>Necrophos, Sadist</i>"
	"CardLore_10058" 	"I'm not oblivious to my reputation.  I won't even pretend that it's un-earned.  I've lead the Red Mist from town to town taking whatever it is we want... and what we want is to survive.  So yes. I am a warlord.  I have done and will do unspeakable things.  But make no mistake, I am no conqueror.   I am the Savior of the Oglodi.  It's just an unfortunate reality that my people's salvation means your people's destruction. — <i>Sorla, Khan of the Red Mist</i>"
	"CardLore_10177" 	"There is no city so secure that it's out of the Red Mist's reach.  Anything is possible given enough preparation. — <i>Sorla Khan, Warmonger</i>"
	"CardLore_10056" 	"My feelings on the war in roseleaf are... complicated.  Neither the bronze legion nor the red mist are threats to my people, and yet my cousins willingly intercede on the Vhoul's behalf.  Their fondness for such frail creatures is strange to me, but none the less they call for my aid, and I am compelled to answer. — <i>Rooftrellen, the Treant Protector</i>"
	"CardLore_10117" 	"To fight alongside Rooftrellen is a great honor. With his help I have no doubt that these trespassers will be removed in no time.  But even still, sometimes I am filled with doubt.  Today it is the Red Mist and Bronze Legion.  Tomorrow it will be the keen.  When will the despoiling of our home ever end... — <i>Aubgraw, Roseleaf Druid</i>"
	"CardLore_10054"	"I've given myself to the Vigil Knights.  I will train with them.  Learn their ways.   Become the best... and ultimately: destroy them from within. — <i>Sven, Knight of the Vigil</i>"
	"CardLore_10330"	"I am not yet strong enough to avenge my father's execution.  But in time... I will be. — <i>Sven, Preparing for Vengeance</i>"
	"CardLore_10052"	"So there I was: drinking with my friends, well actually I was drinking alone but I was thinking about my friends so it's basically the same thing.  Anyway. Sniper walks into my workshop and is like 'Mazzie, you're wasting your life' and I'm like 'Geeze Sniper, if I wanted to feel bad about myself I'd ask my parents why they never visit me on my birthday' but Sniper's not interested in hearing about parental abandonment, he's interested in uniting the Keenfolk clans.  So I say I'll help: on the condition that I get to give our group a cool name.  Sniper rolled his eyes and sighed, which is basically the same thing as a yes, and THAT'S how the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk was born. — <i>Mazzie, Founding Member of the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk</i>"
	"CardLore_10179"	"When you have a whole town looking to destroy your workshop, you get pretty good at reinforcing buildings. — <i>Mazzie, People Person</i>"
	"CardLore_10050"	"For too long the Keenfolk have been fractured.  Little colonies spread across the world each coveting their own research... but as we kept to our workshops the world around us changed.  Stonehall rose to power.  The nation of Revtel was born.  The Quroum of Weeping Rose grew bolder... and what did we do?  We toiled and tinkered.  We built wondrous machines and used them for petty tasks.  This cannot continue.   The Keenfolk clans need to unite, and show the world what we're capable of. — <i>Kardel, the Sniper</i>"
	"CardLore_10272"	"Don't get me wrong I'm impressed with what these young Keen are able to dream up, but lasers and robots take away the artistry of killing a man.  In my day you had to have skill and patience to assassinate someone at range.  Now they just set off an explosion. — <i>Sniper reminisces about the good old days</i>"
	"CardLore_10048"	"The Tyler Estate.  It seeks to control magic. Punish those that violate rules set by the Quorum.  But I will show them that some things cannot be controlled.  And when the Tyler Estate Burns, I will set my sights on Weeping Rose itself. — <i>Pugna, Ill-Tempered Nihilist</i>"
	"CardLore_10173"	"You could tell me that there are more sublime things than watching a wizard slowly kill themselves... but I'm not sure I'd believe you. — <i>Pugna, Maniacal Tormentor</i>"
	"CardLore_10047"	"The Veiled Sisterhood gave me everything.  My life. My skills. My family...  My very purpose.  So when the Veiled Oracles provide me a list of names, I never question what it is I need to do. — <i>Mortred, the Phantom Assassin</i>"
	"CardLore_10308"	"I'm immoral, not a sadist.  If I am asked to kill you it will be clean and quick. — <i>Phantom Assassin, Efficient Killer</i>"
	"CardLore_10755"	"The Dire Child has begun to come into her own.  She will need guidance.  Molding.  She has chosen the beast to be her champion... but I shall be her seneschal...and eventually... her master. — <i>Harbinger, the Outworld Devourer</i>"
	"CardLore_10757"	"For me, the void is a place of reflection and peace... but to my enemies, it is a realm of inscrutable horror. — <i>Outworld Devourer, Master of the Void</i>"
	"CardLore_10044"	"Something is stirring in Roseleaf.  I'm not referring to Stonehall's war machine, or the Red Mist Horde... no... those are problems of flesh and blood, distractions keeping attention divided from the real danger.  The Court of Ristul.  But I cannot face this danger alone, and so I hope to meet with Luna of the Dark Moon.  With the combined might of Selemene and the All Seeing One, we may have a chance. — <i>Omniknight, Devoted to the Allseeing One</i>"
	"CardLore_10348"	"Once I doubted my faith; but no longer.  The All Seeing one has chosen me to be its champion and I will not let the Omniscience down. — <i>Omniknight, Rewarded For His Faith</i>"
	"CardLore_10043"	"'It's not easy being the smartest ogre in the world.  There's lots of jealous people out there.'  <br>'Think about how many people you know with one head.'  <br>'I bet it's a lot.'  <br>'Now realize that every single one of them is half as smart as us.  Do you know how lonely it is to walk this earth, never finding an intellectual eq-' <br>'WE LIKE ROCKS!'  <br>'Yes...yes we do.' — <i>Aggron Stonebreak, the Ogre Magi</i>"
	"CardLore_10160"	"'I think we're probably the first person to figure out that fire can be used not just to cook meat.  But also light people on fire.'  <br>'If not the first, definitely in the top five.' — <i>Ogre Magi, Innovator</i>"
	"CardLore_10038"	"Opportunity calls to me in Roseleaf.  Lion flees to Weeping Rose, and will undoubtedly be looking for allies to aid him.  The Vhoul are losing their battle against The Bronze Legion and are willing to do anything for victory... and the Crystal Maiden of Icewrack happens to be on holiday.  It truly is an embarrassment of riches.  The only lingering question is who should I kill first. — <i>Ethreain, the Lich</i>"
	"CardLore_10318"	"Could I simply cast out a wave of frost?  Certainly.  But flash freezing your enemies isn't nearly as satisfying as watching them panic before their impending death. — <i>Lich on savoring the moment</i>"
	"CardLore_10036"	"Rix.  Tresdin.  Sorla Khan.  You ask any one of them and they will spin you a story about why their cause is just; and every single one of them is wrong.  This war is senseless, its cost will be immeasurable, and the only people who will profit are the future historians who'll sell books about the massacre.  I can't stop this war from happening... but I will do whatever I can to minimize the damage. — <i>Aiustha, the Enchantress</i>"
	"CardLore_10193"	"I'm not a fighter.  I'm a protector.  It's not too late for you to walk away, but if you try to hurt these people, I promise it will not go well for you. — <i>Enchantress takes a stand</i>"
	"CardLore_10033"	"My existence shouldn't be.  I was not born of a mother, but from a rock...and yet I was carved by no artisan.  No... I willed my consciousness into being.    For so long, I walked alone... confused... but that all changed when I met Kanna.  I was rudderless, and she gave me direction.  I was ignorant of the ways of man, and she gave me understanding.  I was alone in this world, and she gave me companionship.    But above all, she gave me a name and sense of self.  Once I called myself Raigor Stonehoof...but she has given me a new name that is far more fitting...Earthshaker. — <i>Earthshaker, Adopted Son</i>"
	"CardLore_10323"	"Prellex is raising an army to destroy her daughter, but I won't allow that to happen.  Let them come in droves... no one will get past me. — <i>Earthshaker, Protector of Kanna</i>"— <i>
	"CardLore_10032"	"Power is a funny thing.  It's something we all want but are taught to be ashamed to seek.  But power is neither good nor evil.  It's freedom. It's the ability to live the life you choose, on the terms that you want.  People like to criticize where that power came from but in time, history forgets... and only remembers what you chose to do with it.  People can judge me for helping Kanna.  But in time they will understand. — <i>Traxex, the Drow Ranger</i>"
	"CardLore_10339"	"Never take victory for granted... the moment you assume there's nothing an enemy can do to stop you, is the moment you're most likely to lose.— <i>Drow Ranger, Spoiler</i>"
	"CardLore_10906"	"I am a woman of my word.  I promised my mother that I would find a way to fix my frail body, and I found salvation in the Dire.  In exchange I promised the Dire a mighty army... and here you stand.  And on the day we built this citadel I promised I would give you purpose... and you have found it in the glory of battle and the honor of serving The Dire.   I am a woman of my word, and today I make a new promise:  soon Prellex's body will be crushed in the rubble of her false god, and on that day you will be rewarded beyond all measure. — <i>Kanna, Priestess of the Dire</i>"
	"CardLore_10325"	"There's something particularly satisfying about watching Radiant zealots run for their lives. — <i>Kanna, The Cruelty of Youth</i>"
	"CardLore_10909"	"They smell blood, but what they track is fear. — <i>Kanna, Dire Child</i>"
	"CardLore_10029"	"Every year the Marrowfell Centaurs send their bravest warriors into Roseleaf to hunt Thunderhides... to them this gruesome safari is a rite of passage, but I will not let these majestic creatures be hunted for sport.  The only question that remains is how many centaurs will I have to kill before they realize Roseleaf Forest is no longer their hunting grounds. — <i>Karroch, the Beastmaster</i>"
	"CardLore_10136"	"This forest has been my home for many years... and its denizens are quick to come to my aid. — <i>Beastmaster, Friend of the Forest</i>"
	"CardLore_10293"	"I've seen many hunters in my day.  Each one bold.  And strong.  And fearless.  Fearless that is, until they realize they're not the Apex Predator... and then they run like the cowards they are.— <i>Beastmaster, Apex Predator</i>"
	"CardLore_10028"	"Once Pugna used me.  Controlled me.  Owned me.  Eventually I escaped, and while at first I relished in my newfound freedom, as years passed it became a more hollow existence... for a while I thought this ennui came because my tormentor still roamed free, and I wouldn't find peace until I make him suffer as I did.  But after I began my quest for vengeance I came to a realization.  Pugna is not an abnormality.  How many dabble in magic to summon and control.  To create life then force it to obey.  No.  Pugna's enslavement won't bring me peace... but enslaving every wizard?  Now that is something that will help me sleep well at night. — <i>Viper, the Netherdrake</i>"

I smiled when they put the conscript mark on my arm cause I knew that if I worked hard enough, if I followed orders, if I showed valor and skill in battle I would make something of myself and become more than just a stupid savage from redmaw.  And so I followed.  And fought.  And killed.  And with every town we occupied, every insurrection we quelled, every voice of dissent I silenced, the words 'for the glory of Stonehall' grew hollower, and that bronzed mark I took pride in became heavier.  So now we march through Roseleaf to intercept the Red Mist Horde, and again my Commander has asked me to 'speak to my savage people'...  well speak to them I shall... and when I do, they'll understand that I will fight beside them until every soldier is sent back to Stonehall in a bronzed coffin.  — <i>Rix, Leader of the Vhoul Rebellion</i>"

So mistakes were made and now we're back to where we started with the Jasper Circle debt only this time the Ravenhooks won't take us back because, ya know, we robbed them.  We're freaking out and pointing fingers, and that's when Meepo 3 sees a wanted poster for our old friend Mireska.  Now Lord Sunbreeze has put a huge bounty on his daughter that would cover the Jasper debt in spades, but A: Mireska's a friend... and more importantly B: there was no way we'd get to her before Gondar did.
