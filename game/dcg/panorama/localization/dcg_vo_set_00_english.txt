	"DCG_VO_lady_anshu_intro"	"I know some of you supported the vhoul rebellion... that you believed Rix’s cause was just; and that Galanius was a tyrant who needed to be shown that the world wasn’t his.  I understand why you felt that way.  It doesn’t matter anymore.  Rix has taken The Oath; and in exchange for his soul the Court of Ristul has given him the means to destroy Stonehall.  Is Galanius a monster?  Maybe.  But at least he is of the living. We will not stand idle while demons butcher the men, women, and children of Stonehall.  We will march. And we will fight.  And yes, many of us will die; but we offer our lives not out of foolishness but out of necessity... because if we don’t stop the dead and the damned... who will?"
	"DCG_VO_lady_anshu_psalm_of_st_crell"	" Death is natural, as is our fear of it.  But hear me now and understand:  Death is not a monster that can be slain.  It is not source of power that can be bent to your will, nor a slave that will do your bidding.  So when Death comes for you, greet it not with fear - for the fear you show Death will be mirrored in the sorrow shown by those who love you.  No.  It is better to great Death warmly... with poise and courage; to be an example to your friends, so that they too can be couragous in your absence."
	"DCG_VO_lady_anshu_rumusque_scythe"	"The dead may be strong, but our faith is stronger."
	"DCG_VO_lady_anshu_shield_of_st_crell"	"Watch over us Crella... give us strength in the face of certain death, and wisdom to not repeat your folly."
